           <b>English, Distinguished Professor. <em>Maps, Mapping and Literature</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> The presentation will discuss some of the complications that arise in the use of maps--the necessary distortions, eliminations, stylizations and so forth.  It will then go on to discuss some novels in which actual maps are important, such as Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island and H. Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines.</p>

<p><strong><u>September 12 - Marick Masters</u></strong> <br />
<b>           Labor at Wayne, Director of Labor at Wayne. <em>Collective Bargaining as a Fundamental Right: 
Competing Perspectives and Arguments</em></b><br />
<b>Abstract:</b> The role of collective bargaining in 
the United States is currently the 
topic of considerable debate and 
interest.  In recent months, 
legislators in several states, including 
Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and 
Michigan, enacted legislation to 
impose limits on the right of 
collective bargaining, particularly in 
the public sectors.  In this talk, I 
examine the competing perspectives 
and arguments about the rationale 
for collective bargaining in both the 
private and public sectors.  We will 
also talk about the rationale for 
union security agreements relative to 
right-to-work and the role of unions 
in politics.</p>

<b>           CMLLC (German), Assistant Professor. <em>Detroit's Immigrant Language Press at the Turn of the Century</em></b><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>In this brownbag presentation, Professor Lucht will talk about the history of the immigrant press in Detroit, looking specifically at the role of newspapers in language maintenance and shift in immigrant communities of the late 1800s and early to mid-1900s.  During this time in Detroit, one could find papers in Bulgarian, Finnish, Dutch, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Ukrainian and Yiddish.  These papers helped to preserve the languages of the communities, but also acted as agents of change and assimilation.      
Although many of Detroit's immigrant language papers were short-lived and folded like many other smaller papers of the time, some are still in publication today, such as the Nordamerikanische Wochen-Post (German) and the Gazette van Detroit (Dutch and English). </p>

<p><strong><u>September 19 - Joan Beaudoin</u></strong> <br />
<b>           Library and Information Science, Assistant Professor. <em>A Case Study of Visual Literacy among Library and Information Science Students</em></b><br />
<b>Abstract:</b> It is widely acknowledged that we live in a increasingly visual world and yet knowledge concerning visual information continues to lag behind that of the printed or spoken word among the general population. This new visual paradigm, driven in large part by technological developments enabling the easy exchange and display of images, has brought into sharper focus the lack of knowledge and training concerning visual information. As access to visual information is largely dependent on the descriptive information associated with an image, there is a critical need to perform this work well. This study examines the development of visual literacy skills among library and information science students. Their progress is traced through a series of exercises and learning tools developed to increase their understanding of visual information and the unique challenges of producing descriptive metadata for images. The findings of the study point to several general patterns of visual literacy development as well as revealing the high degree of frustration experienced by the students in their attempts to perform the work.</p>

<p><strong><u>September 26 - Mysoon Rizk</u></strong> <br />
          <b> Department of Art, Associate Professor University of Toledo. <em>SILENCE STILL = DEATH: The Hide/Seek Exhibition Saga</em></b><br />
          <b>Abstract:</b>The slogan "SILENCE STILL = DEATH" appeared on flyers and placards designed for street demonstrations organized against the Smithsonian Institution's November 30, 2010 censorship of late American artist David Wojnarowicz's Super-8 film A Fire in My Belly (1986-87). Converted to video, this work had gone on view at the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) on October 30, in conjunction with the large group exhibition Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture. Under Congressional pressure to cancel the entire groundbreaking show--"the first major museum exploration of the impact of same-sex desire in the creation of modern American portraiture," says Wikipedia--the self-proclaimed world's largest museum complex instead singled out and scapegoated the less than four-minute video snippet of Wojnarowicz's work. Sparking what has come to be regarded as the second culture wars, the Smithsonian suppression of A Fire in My Belly offers what one critic describes as "a splendid case study in cowardice, censorship, and institutional failure," with the Wojnarowicz affair performing the very premise and relevance of Hide/Seek.</p>

    <p><strong><u>October 02 - Chera Kee</u></strong> <br />
           <b>English, Assistant Professor. <em>Racialized and Raceless: Visions of Race After Death in Post-Apocalyptic Zombie Worlds</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> While many zombie films of the last decade have presented racially heterogeneous depictions of the living, very few envision the dead as similarly diverse. It would seem that, to borrow from Richard Dyer, death in these films is decidedly white.  Further complicating this is the fact that in the majority of these films, the zombies will triumph over living survivors, so in a sense, the future is set: no matter how diverse the living may be, once they die and reanimate, the world becomes that much whiter.  However, in George Romero's Land of the Dead (2005) and a handful of other films, the racial identities of zombies become a key part of a film's commentary on social relations and revolution. These films envision a life-after-death where race does not disappear and yet, this is not necessarily couched in negative terms.  In these films, the future seems to have room for all kinds of bodies?both living and dead.  Exploring these differing visions of race after death in post-apocalyptic zombie worlds, we can see that while it is tempting to focus on living survivors, the undead provide a far more compelling contemplation of what humanity's racial future entails.</p>

           <b>Sociology, Assistant Professor. <em>Worker Commitment over the Gendered Life Course at a Mexican Company</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> In an economic climate of instability and uncertainty, employers are paying attention to what factors and conditions promote workplace commitment. Scholarship identifies individual and job characteristics as well as the workplace context as factors that influence organizational commitment. The purpose of this presentation is to examine the link between work-family policies and worker commitment over the life course at a Mexican-owned multinational company. Using qualitative data from fieldwork, I explore how employees come to characterize the workplace as a caring and respectful setting. In return, they describe how they are more productive, loyal, and committed to the company. I present three findings. First, women and men perceive the wide array of family-friendly policies offered by the company is an indication that management cares about them and their families. Second, they also believe management values a family-friendly work environment because conditions exist at the company to include their family. But, third, the meanings women and men attach to specific policies and programs vary over the life course stages, particularly if they are married and/or have children. In sum, employees perceive management's actions promote a family-friendly environment, but their distinct interpretations of the family-friendly policies reveal how the gendered life course shapes women's and men's experiences in the workplace.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> There is much scholarly uncertainty surrounding the tragedies of Seneca, including who wrote them and for what purpose. But one definite fact is often overlooked: that the plays were in some fashion "published" ? that is, they were made available to the general public. This presentation explores what can be pieced together about "publication" in 1st Century Rome, and then uses that evidence to shed new light on Senecan tragedy. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> This presentation examines the rhetoric used by proponents of educational reform and the use of online learning as a solution for K-12 education. Using the research into K-12 online learning, I argue that those educational reformers use methodologically flawed research or promote an inaccurate understanding of research results to promote a corporate agenda in K-12 online learning. During the session, I will examine the limited amount of research into virtual schooling in an effort to better understand what this research indicates about the effectiveness of K-12 online learning. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Professor Sedler will discuss the constitutional challenges and the different holdings in the case. A five Justice majority (Chief Justice Roberts, joined on this point by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan) upheld the Act as a constitutional exercise of the taxing and spending power and so gave a political victory to the President. Because this was so, it did not matter from a political standpoint that five Justices (Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Roberts and Alito) were of the opinion that the Act could not be sustained as an exercise of Congress' power over interstate commerce. (This part of the decision is of interest to constitutional law professors and few others). The Court also held that Congress could not force the states to agree to expand Medicaid or lose all federal funding, thus giving the states a "states rights" victory. 

Professor Sedler will conclude the discussion with some observations about the Supreme Court as both a constitutional and political institution.  </p>

           <b>Education, Assistant Professor. <em>Poverty as Trauma: Impact on Children and Adolescents Psychosocial, Cognitive and Educational Development</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> Trauma can be defined as a stressor an event or situation that disrupts the equilibrium of the organism. Traumatic events are extraordinary, not because they occur rarely, but rather because they overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life. The stressor creates a treat to the individual physical integrity and well-being and causes feelings of helplessness, powerlessness, and disorganization especially in children and adolescents (Osofsky, Osofsky, & Harris, 2007; American Psychological Association, 1994).  
Living in poverty significantly increases children exposure to social and public incivilities, homelessness, social isolation, educational instability / lack of educational opportunities, lack of employment opportunities and related unemployment, incarceration, and reliance on public assistance (Kiser, 2006; Dempsey, Overstreet & Moely, 2000).
The purpose of this presentation is threefold: (1) to provide an overview of the research showing the correlation between poverty and trauma and its' impact on children's and adolescents physical, emotional and intellectual development and subsequent educational outcomes; (2) to show the impact of poverty as trauma through culturally diverse lens and (3) to provide strategies for trauma informed care. </p>

           <b>History, Associate Professor. <em>Lessons from Without Sanctuary</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> In 2000, a photography exhibit that came to be called "Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America," opened in New York City and began traveling across the nation. The materials, which included lynching photographs and postcards, came from the collection of James Allen, who had collected the images from flea markets, antique shops, and individual purchases and wanted to share his findings with the public. Scholars from across the disciplines hailed the presentation of this exhibit (and the accompanying website and book) because the memorabilia of photographs and postcards as well as the accompanying texts of newspaper reports and placards identifying victims provided "irrefutable proof" of lynching's existence in the United States. Many of the exhibit's proponents believed that displaying lynching photography would help the U.S. to achieve a degree of racial reconciliation. Americans and tourists flocked to the exhibitions. Only by examining the comment books from the exhibitions that we can fully apprehend what, if anything, attendees learned from viewing Without Sanctuary. In this talk, Kidada E. Williams will share her research findings from her examination of materials from the Wright Museum's "Bearing Witness, Baring our Souls" exhibition and consider whether the exhibition lived up to its promise. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> The past is unmistakably present in these, the final days of Campaign 2012.   As President Obama and Governor Romney vie for votes, the arguments they articulate and the tactics they employ evoke a complicated American political past.
In "The 2012 Presidential Campaign in Historical Perspective," Liette Gidlow explores the dynamic interplay of past and present on today's critical issues.  Why do many Americans believe that "government should be run like a business"?  Why have ballot access issues ? voter ID laws and challenges to early voting ? become key sites of the contest?  How do the leading candidates manipulate the "threat of China" to win support?  How have the campaigns drawn upon party traditions to cultivate the support of women?  Gidlow examines these and other issues as she places the 2012 campaign into historical context. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Lafayette Park in downtown Detroit is home to the largest collection of buildings designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in the world. Thanks for the View, Mr. Mies, examines the way that residents confront and interact with this unique modernist environment. Lafayette Park is examined through interviews with and essays by residents of the buildings, giving the reader an understanding of the organic and idiosyncratic ways that people actually use the unique modernist architecture that they live with on a daily basis. The book was conceived, edited, and designed by graphic designers Danielle Aubert, Lana Cavar, and Natasha Chandani, and published by Metropolis Books. In this talk, Danielle Aubert will speak about the origins of the project, the research, the experience of editing and designing a book simultaneously, and how this process affected the final form of the project. </p>

           <b>Curriculum Instruction/Science Education, Professor. <em>Teacher Practical Arguments</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012) that embodies three intertwined K-12 "dimensions of science learning": Scientific and engineering practices; Crosscutting concepts; and Disciplinary Core Ideas in the sciences and engineering has been considered pivotal for STEM higher learning and STEM careers. This alternative framework for science education calls for teacher change. Gary Fenstermacher's philosophical discourse on the theory of practical arguments that encourages teachers to think more deliberatively and robustly about their pedagogical practices seems defensible. The theory of practical arguments is guided by four premises:  Value Premise--benefit to be derived from an act; Situational Premise?describes the context in which the teacher's action takes place; Empirical Premise?makes a claim subject to scrutiny or test; and Stipulative Premise?defines, interprets or establishes meaning.  Together, these premises represent an intention of actions. The "Other" plays a critical role in the elicitation, appraisal, and reconstruction of practical arguments. Recent classroom studies provide evidence of teachers' practical arguments. A study is being developed to understand the sorts of practical arguments scientists and engineers advance as they educate the Detroit Area science teachers and translate their experiences working with teachers into their own teaching practices in university classrooms. </p>

           <b>Law School, Professor. <em>Down Freedom's Main Line</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> Two principal trends define this post-Cold War, post-9/11 era of globalization. First is the spread of market economies under the neoliberal aegis colloquially known as the Washington consensus. The second, more fitful development is the spread of democracy. The initial wave saw democracies emerge in post-communist, Central and Eastern Europe countries and post-Apartheid South Africa. The current wave began with the uprisings in the  Middle East known collectively as the "Arab Spring." Similar popular protest is afoot in the   established democracies: particularly the         anti-corruption movement in India, but also the Occupy Wall Street movement that has spread across the United States and to Western Europe. Professor Winter will be  talking more about the distinction between the two trends and how they reflect different conceptions of freedom and democracy. </p>

However, most are less aware of the fact that there are other groups of Iraqi descendants who have moved to the United States. Several of these groups also have sizeable groups of residents in the Detroit area. This presentation will focus on the various groups of Iraqi descendants who make Detroit their home.

           <b>Abstract:</b> Among the effects of the historic  McGregor-Cowan House in Old Sandwich that entered the used-book market in Windsor in 2011 was a copy of Giovanni Battista Benedetti's collected works, his Speculationum Liber (Venice edition of 1599). This paper will consider the contents of this book and its handwritten annotations, which bear on mathematics, physics, engineering, astronomy and many other subjects, in the context of Italy's scientific climate circa 1600. Palaeographical study of the annotations, in combination with the academic context of their contents and further circumstantial evidence, suggests that this book may have been Galileo Galilei's personal copy that was plagiarized by him in his Sidereus Nuncius of 1610 and other works.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> The historic 2011 uprising in Egypt brought an end to a three-decade dictatorship and saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood as the country's leading political actor. But in exploring the recent emergence of this longstanding social movement, few analyses have taken account of its historical development and the experiences of its current leadership. In this talk, Abdullah Al-Arian will explore how the formative period of the 1970s, a dynamic era that saw the rise of student protests and the  Islamic movement's return after a twenty year absence, helped shape the current landscape of oppositional politics in Egypt. Tracing these developments through the lives of leading figures, from political activists like Esam al-Erian and Abdul Moneim Abul Futuh, to Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, allows for the development of a more complete portrait of Egypt's contentious political scene. To discern what path these leaders have charted for their country's future, it is essential to understand the road that led them here.</p>

           <b>Law, Director of Graduate Studies. <em>Treaty as Contract, Treaty as Statute, Treaty as Executive Act, Treaty as Nothing at All</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> The creation and observance of treaties was extremely important to the generation that met in Philadelphia. The Founders wrote a document that expressly addresses the process by which the United States enters into treaties, the relationship of treaties to state law, and the authority of courts to adjudicate cases involving treaties. Yet, with respect to seemingly fundamental treaty-related questions, the Constitution is silent. Perhaps the most important of these  questions is how treaties are to be interpreted. <br /><br />
Beginning in the early years of the Republic, American courts filled this textual vacuum by employing what might be called the "treaty-as-contract" analogy. We begin by examining the decline of the contract metaphor and the rise of competing metaphors: the "treaty-as-statute" and the "treaty-as-executive act." Next we consider the reasons for these recent developments, which follow so long a period of time in which the contract analogy has predominated. Finally, we consider what all this means for the future of  American foreign policy.</p>

H?xan is a singular work on many levels, bearing its own unique relation to all of these issues and yet not reducible to any one of them.

           <b>Abstract:</b> Anchor institutions, especially universities and hospitals, in disinvested urban neighborhoods have become increasingly visible as agents of neighborhood improvement. These "eds and meds" anchors typically control significant resources, are committed to remaining in the city, and require improved neighborhood environments to compete successfully. Working in this tradition, Wayne State          University, the Detroit Medical Center, and Henry Ford Health System launched in 2011 a much heralded effort to stimulate the growth of Midtown by providing an attractive package of financial incentives for their employees to move to the neighborhood. This seminar will present early results from the "Live Midtown" initiative, position them in the context of broader efforts to revitalize the Woodward corridor, and assess the program's potential to stimulate new development.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Similar to other Arab popular outcries during the Uprisings of 2011/12, popular demands in the Arab Gulf were for citizenship rights of participation, transparency, and justice. While the voices differed from muted (such as in Kuwait & Oman) to revolutionary (such as in Bahrain &Yemen) they all followed the same essential demand of struggle to move from under an autocratic to a participatory rule. Such have been the path for democratization that predated these uprisings but have been energized and galvanized by the overall trends in the region. Bahrain stands as the most potent example of this history and process while the struggle is still on. Using documentations of the events and oral testimonies of participants, May Seikaly brings this story to a WSU audience.</p>

           <b>History, Assistant Professor. <em>Of Pirate Drivers and Honking Horns: Mobility, Authority, and Urban Planning in Interwar Accra (Ghana)</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> Throughout the 1930s, the Accra Town Council complained repeatedly of the presence of "pirate passenger lorries", which were said to be plying the roads between central Accra (the capital of the Gold Coast Colony) and the eastern suburb of Labadi. The language of piracy highlights the degree to which these passenger lorries threatened the authority of the colonial state and the foundations of the colonial order. Lorries, which came from the cocoa-producing, agricultural eastern interior of the colony, would off-load some goods in Labadi, which effectively served as an eastern gateway to the city. As they continued on into central Accra, where the city's primary market was located, lorry drivers traveled on the same roads that were covered by the municipal bus service, picking up passengers along the roadside. While colonial officials attempted to limit the competition of these lorries in the municipal passenger transit sector, the persistence of their practices highlight both the limitations of state authority and the autonomy of African urban residents in the colonial capital. This paper argues that contestations over the practices of drivers in Accra?how they move within and through the city?reflects a broader disconnect between colonial visions for the capital and African uses of the city.</p>

           <b>Theatre, Assistant Professor. <em>Writing from Memory</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> This essay proposes that the affective turn in performance scholarship, which has elevated the status of Performance-as-Research in some respects, requires a corresponding re-examination of existing models of reflective practice, which compartmentalize reflection temporally and orient the writer towards reflection as a form of "problem-solving," implicitly encouraging narratives of amelioration. Taking a cue from Sally Mackey's retrospective analysis of a performance event from her distant past, and pairing this approach with John Baldacchino's recommendation that we embrace art's "groundless forms of meaning" which are "beyond product and process," this paper draws on fragments of reflective writing that I've collected, collated and manipulated in response to a performance training experience now seven years old. Seeking out examples of a hybrid form of performative-reflective composition, I have endeavored to work from Anne Brewster's idea of a writing that "literalizes a post-retrieval idea of memory" in which writing "is not an instrument of the retrieval of stored information" but instead is "characterized as a technology of memory, and memory as tekhne, writing."  To this extent, I will explore these writings as a set of attempts or gestures that seek to include, to incorporate, to absorb reflective writing as a performative act and as a generative process that lives within the "what" and "when" of performance-making, although it occurs after the "performance" is over.</p>

           <b>CMLLC (Arabic), Assistant Professor. <em>Migration and the Development of Arabic in the Middle East</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> The arabicization of the Middle East in the 7th and 8th centuries was made possible by migration and urbanization. The talk suggests that establishing garrison towns, the concentration of Arabs in these towns, and the subsequent migration of local populations established the Arabic language as a majority language of prestige. The Arabs' need to communicate for practical reasons allowed them to use simplified registers known in similar modern contexts of language contact as Foreigner Talk registers. Imperial migration policies permitted Arabs to migrate to garrison towns only if they belonged to the same tribes that took part in the initial conquest of the province, which permitted only a limited number of Arabic dialects to mix for a long time in the new urban centers. Eventually,        differences among the dialects were leveled and structures regularized. A new urban koine emerged in every garrison town that was both different from the original dialects of Arabic in the peninsula and from each other. I suggests that these linguistic processes of simplification and koinization shaped the input that was learnt by the local populations, and caused the difference between the old dialects of Arabic and the new urban dialects in the Arab world.</p>

           <b>Political Science and Peace and Conflict Studies, Professor/Director. <em>Inter-Organizational Complexities in Humanitarian Interventions in  
               World Politics</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> The sequencing of international military interventions into civil and international conflicts has long been a matter of interest for scholarship and policy-making; yet at this point we know relatively little about the patterns one might expect in going from one intervention to the next. Increasingly since the end of the cold war such interventions have entailed joint multilateral efforts by one or more international coalition or organization often for the expressed purpose of humanitarian protection or relief, e.g., Libya in 2012. It has been clear as well that incidents of intervention in many cases are highly political in nature and not entirely independent of each other, as seen in subsequent debates about what to do in Syria. We propose that learning processes may be taking place to iron out the inevitable inter-organizational conflicts in humanitarian operations, but that the spread or pattern of going from one intervention to the next is dependant on both "push" and "pull" factors attracting and retarding multilateral collaboration. Previous impediments to collaboration in intervention have been lessened by the removal of superpower competition that often threatened to result in vetoes of action. Yet as the Syrian crisis has shown, the threat of major power (Russian or Chinese) veto and the persistence of sovereignty norms still hangs over the prospect of institutional response to local emergencies. The likely outcomes of these complex contradictions are analyzed in this research based on both aggregate data patterns and case studies.</p>

           Becoming Queer/Queer Becoming:  Art, Affect, and the Dissolution of Being (Human)
           </em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> The domestication of the term queer, now largely mainstreamed and employed, it seems, as a "funky" way to designate (male) homosexuality, as well as the sedimentation of its function as an adjective or noun, rather than a verb, may go some way to suggest why, in the eyes of many of its former practitioners, queer theory is "over." Rather than  resigning myself to this fact, and give up on queer altogether, however, I argue that it is the affective turn, and, more specifically, the so-called new vitalism, that at once inscribes the centrality of queer theory in the emergence of the nonhuman turn generally, and that, more specifically, offers possibilities for pursuing a more radical project of ontological dissolution than either a psychoanalytic or a deconstructive model of gender and sexual(de)construction allows.
In this paper, I will focus on the active participation of nonhuman forces in the ongoing event of un/becoming queer, with particular focus on the operation of art, with its immediate affective power over and beyond its potential semiotic functions, as a privileged site, or forcefield, of non/human deterritorialization.</p>

           <b>Abstract: </b>During the second half of the 19th century, use of mass  media revolutionized advertising in Japan. Merchants and manufacturers took  advantage of newly created newspapers and magazines as well as lithographic  technology and more aggressively tried to sell their goods. Iwaya Matsuhei  quickly gained a reputation as one of the most innovative and strategic of  advertisers. To hawk his cigarettes, he branded them with the name &ldquo;tengu,&rdquo; a  term historically used for magical red goblins characterized by long noses. Not  only did images of the goblins appear on cigarette cartons, match boxes,  posters, signboards, and? newspaper  advertisements, but virtually all things related to his business made use of  the color red, from the jackets Iwaya wore, to the advertising wagon he rode,  to the walls of some of his stores. Iwaya&rsquo;s efforts to corner the cigarette  market with such schemes elicited a strong response from Murai Kichibei, his  top competitor, and the two ultimately embarked on a vicious advertising war in  the 1890s. In her talk, Lublin will explore this battle, the tactics Iwaya and  Murai used, and their impact on the advertising industry in Japan at the turn  of the century.</p>

           <b>Anthropology, Assistant Professor. <em>Greatness in the Math Corps Family</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> For twenty years, the Math Corps program at Wayne State has provided mathematical enrichment and social support for students from Detroit Public Schools. A key part of its social and moral framework is the core concept of greatness.  This study uses ethnographic methods, metaphor analysis, and corpus linguistics to analyze a cultural model for greatness at the Math Corps. An analysis of moral and social discourse produced by Math Corps staff reveals eight interrelated metaphorical understandings of greatness, which is conceptualized as a resource inside all individuals that motivates success.    Comparing this understanding with general corpora of spoken American English demonstrates that the Math Corps cultural model differs systematically from other understandings of greatness. These metaphorical understandings are not only verbal, but also gestural and graphic, and are rapidly learned and internalized by new students in the Math Corps family. This cultural model produces a framework for decision and action for students and staff; most importantly, it motivates and promotes student success in a challenging educational environment.  The integration of linguistic anthropology, corpus linguistics, and discourse analysis in this study suggest ways that conceptual metaphor and cultural models can be studied in other speech communities.</p>

           <b>Sociology, Assistant Professor. <em>Re-Assessing the Role of Student Attitudes and Beliefs</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b>Since the 1980s scholarship on student attitudes and  beliefs has been heavily influenced by the oppositional culture perspective,  which proposes that African American students fare poorly in?????? academics because they reject schooling  as a means of status attainment. Moreover, the opposition culture perspective  fits neatly within &lsquo;colorblind&rsquo; narratives that suggest equality of opportunity  has been achieved and that remaining racial disparities in educational achievement  are due to the dispositional characteristics of African American students.  However, empirical evidence on student attitudes and beliefs indicates that  African American students have more positive attitudes towards school than  their white counterparts, and that African American students generally endorse  hard work and? effort? as paths?  to success. Despite the lack of empirical support for the oppositional  culture model, few new theoretical approaches to understanding student  attitudes and beliefs have been advanced and the oppositional culture model  continues to frame scholarship and?  popular debates regarding the role that student attitudes play in racial  disparities. This paper argues that a view of student beliefs and?? attitudes based in the concept of Black  habitus (Moore, 2004; 2008) has the potential to move scholarship beyond the  oppositional culture perspective and its color-blind implications.?</p>

           <b>English, Distinguished Professor Emeritus. <em>The Poetry Nobody Knows: Rare or Unique Verse in Early Modern English Manuscripts </em>Anthropology, Professor.</b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b>In various archives in Great Britain and the U.S. there are hundreds of manuscripts from the early modern period that contain poetic texts. Those associated with major and minor canonical authors have been accounted for, edited, and made part of literary history. Those that are anonymous or are by little known writers have largely been ignored. This lecture will discuss a selection of (mostly anonymous) rare or unique poems found in surviving manuscript poetry collections of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in relation to the familial, collegial, and other coterie environments in which they were written. This includes verse composed by manuscript compilers, politically dangerous or obscene texts, and texts related to scandals and topical events of local interest. Among the examples chosen are a poem dealing with a case of mother-son incest and verse dealing with a cause c?l?bre in Oxford, the supposed providential revival of a hanged woman who was unjustly convicted of infanticide. Looking at the large body of rare or unique manuscript verse from the period, I argue that these neglected texts, which expand our sense of the writing practices in the period, not only need to be acknowledged in literary history, but also studied for what they reveal about the social life of early modern literary texts.</p>

While racial minorities report experiencing subtle forms of    discrimination across a wide domain of public spaces, existing evidence has highlighted full-service restaurants as one consumer market within which they may be    particularly vulnerable to mistreatment. While there are both theoretical and empirical sources of support        underlying this line of reasoning there is a scarcity of scholarship that has assessed the posited saliency of such subtle and covert forms of racial discrimination in consumer markets, more generally. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b>This exploratory study attempts a comprehensive examination of the policies used by local governments to welcome immigrants. The literature has shown how immigrant friendly policies in the United States often follow rather than precede the establishment of immigrant enclaves in response to the electorate. More recently, some scholars have noted a bureaucratic incorporation process initiated by civil servants. Much research has been done on local government initiative to restrict immigration. Other local governments create polices to proactively recruit and incorporate immigrants to stabilize high poverty urban neighborhoods and open businesses. ?These policies involve direct or indirect incentives for immigrants to enter the community and are not necessarily tied to immigrant integration policies that would facilitate citizenship. What are the characteristics of local governments that pursue these polices? ?This exploratory study uses a generated from policy scan of every municipality and county with a population above 500 persons in the United States to determine whether a pro-immigrant policy was present by 2010. ?This scan utilized internet searches to establish a list of municipalities and counties with possible pro-immigrant policies.</p>

We then consider the attitudes towards this phenomenon, which go from an absolute rejection of what some consider to be a sign of semilingualism or lack of proficiency in both languages, to a proud defense of what others consider to be their hybrid native language and symbol of their identity as Latinos in the U.S. Finally, we show some examples of recent oral and written texts, which employ both languages, and offer a preliminary analysis of their nature and significance as expressions of a dual and fluid linguistic and cultural identity.</p>

           <b>Anthropology, Professor. <em>Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santer?a: Acculturation of Catholic Saints in African Religions</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b>The African slaves may have been stripped naked and forked on the European trade ships for the Americas, but their minds were covered with their indigenous    cultures, especially their myths and rituals. Some          scholars, traditionally, pretend that the slaves have           used the Catholic saints to hide or cover the African           spirits like Vodun of the Adja in Haiti and Orisha of the      Yoruba in Cuba to mystify their masters in the practice
           of their religions. Other scholars have talked about a
           voluntary act of the slaves, in their struggle for freedom, to embody their resistance in the very body of these
           saints worshipped by the slaveholders in their Catholic churches. In both case, the oppressed would have      appropriated voluntarily the oppressors' sacred icons for socio-cultural and political goals. This lecture intends to discuss the failure of both explanations in regard to the symbolic nature of culture. Illustrations from Haitian and Cuban material cultures will support the argumentation. The lecture will also address the use of &quot;syncretism&quot; to explain the cultural presence of the Catholic saints in the Vodun and Santer?a temples in Haiti and Cuba.</p>

           <b>Music, Associate Chair.</b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b>Nina Simone&rsquo;s 1970&rsquo;s hit by Weldon Irvine best summarizes  the musical and professional essence of Moses Hogan. He was &ldquo;Young, Gifted and  Black.&rdquo; The quintessential protean musician who excelled as composer, arranger,  and pianist, Hogan carved a legacy which will impact the choral world in many  years to come.</p>
            <p>This story has a Detroit connection. Brazeal Dennard  (1929-2010), a Wayne State University Alumnus and the founder of the  award-winning Brazeal Dennard Chorale singularly had the greatest influence on Moses  Hogan&rsquo;s professional life. It was Dennard who recommended that Moses form an  ensemble, which he did, and named first the Moses Hogan Chorale, which later  became the Moses Hogan Singers. With his ensembles, Hogan recorded his 70  published choral works, which continue to be performed by professional and  non-professional ensembles around the world.</p>
            <p>This young, gifted and black man died of a brain tumor in  February 2002 at the age of 45. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of his  death, Professor Duncan will feature the WSU Concert Chorale in a performance  of the complete vocal solo repertoire of Moses Hogan and a few of his more  popular choral works. As a prelude to the performance, he will discuss the  composer&rsquo;s significance and continual influence on the arrangements of  Spirituals published since his death.</p>

           <b>History, Associate Professor.</b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> Guilds in early modern France portrayed themselves as harmonious institutions that seamlessly integrated their members into hierarchical relationships that encouraged efficient production and social concord.      However, an aspect of guild culture that has been overlooked is the charged emotional content of court cases and police complaints. When masters and journeymen testified they employed emotionally charged language that couched their positions not simply in terms of interest and advantage, but also in the          language of the emerging 18th century culture of sentiment, as a means to support their interests, and as a tool to express how they understood identity as members of guilds. I argue that artisans used emotional expressions to push back against the conception of guilds endorsed by masters and jur?s and assert their own vision of artisanal identity and culture.</p>

           Reflections of Novelistic Tradition in Claude
           Simon's <u>The Flanders Road</u></em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b>As one of the most representative works of the New Novel  (Nouveau Roman), Claude Simon&rsquo;s The Flanders Road (1960) marks a radical  departure from the traditional narrative conventions embodied by the  19th-century realist novel&rsquo;s linear storyline, coherent plot, and well-defined  characters. A story focusing on World War II, The Flanders Road develops the  concept of conflict not only thematically, but also stylistically, through  innovative narrative techniques and strategies that disrupt the narrative flow  by challenging the tenets of traditional representation, while also  transforming the reader&rsquo;s experience and relationship with the world of the  text. Our talks will explore various facets of conflict. Beth Chapman will  address the topic of generational conflict as conveyed by a strained father-son  relationship that is rooted in the use of two antagonistic discourses. Adrion  Dula will analyze how epistemological and ontological conflicts are expressed through the  theme of the animality of man in relation to the humanist tradition of the  &ldquo;rational animal.&rdquo; Andre Seewood will tackle the conflict that the practices of  the New Novelists create for today&rsquo;s post-modern reader. Alina Cherry will  focus on novel modalities of temporal representation generated by the  evacuation of traditional chronology. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b>This paper examines the relationship between African customary practices and queerness in post-apartheid South Africa.?I argue that black South African queers reconstitute African &quot;tradition&quot; and customary practices through various forms of cultural and discursive labor that function to contest the un-Africanness of same-sex sexuality and insist on visibility and communal belonging.?Examining customary  practices ranging from circumcision to lobola and traditional African religions, I reveal African &quot;tradition&quot; to be a set of living practices constantly in formation.?The contestation between queerness and African custom reveals a set of practices that are reconstituted. These set of reconstituted practices form &quot;usable traditions&quot; for black South African queers and their allies.?Usable traditions forge an important space for understanding how black sexual autonomy is formed within communal understandings of self. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b>The purpose of my presentation is to analyze the film XXY (2007), directed by the Argentinean writer and film maker Lucia Puenzo, and based on a short story &quot;Cinismo&quot; (&quot;Cynicism&quot;) written by Sergio Bizzio, Puenzo's husband. I will focus on the protagonist, Alex ?a 15 year old born an inter-sex child?and the vicissitudes of being an adolescent dealing not only with this transitional period of development, and his/her own sexual condition but, also, with the violence inflicted by society in his/her body and mind.<br />
           My preliminary hypothesis is that the movie narrative should be read as the presentation of a case (in the Freudian sense, Dora, for example). A case dealing mainly with the inter-sex condition of the protagonist, and its complexity in relation to gender and sexuality, and the social categories of normality/abnormality.<br />

           <b>English Language, Literature, and Creative Writing, Department Head, University of Windsor. <em>Joint Tenant of the Shade: Alexander   
                                Pope and Animal Rights</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b>Alexander Pope's interest in animals is well documented. He strongly opposed the animal     experimentation of his day, and owned a succession of much-loved dogs. Animals appear regularly in Pope's poetry, often as part of an ecological outlook that challenges the traditionally human-centered model of the natural world and cosmos. The poems focus on animal subjectivity, rather than representing them as objects of human activity or as symbols of human notions. They thus create a plurality of      perspectives that challenges human dominance. </p>
  <p>Pope's focus on animal experience reflects contemporary debates about animal materiality, sentience, and intelligence which were part of an emerging school of sensibility and citizenship, key elements in his own satiric stance. This paper examines the notion of animal subjectivity in Pope's poetry and shows how that concept, far from being a mere ancillary indulgence, is in fact key to his poems' ideological complexities and to his own deepest beliefs. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b>Sentence negatives ? words that negate the whole proposition of a sentence, like English &quot;not&quot;? are considered part of the grammatical toolkit of a language, not subject to replacement by borrowing or rapid change over time. Nonetheless, words for this basic function show remarkable variety in closely related languages in Southeast Asia: across the languages of the Tai-Kadai family (to which Thai and Lao belong) there are at least six completely different words for &quot;not&quot;, and across the smaller Hmong-Mien family there are at least three. The questions I  address in this talk are (1) Which of the three Hmong-Mien negatives is the oldest? (2) Where did the newer words come from? (3) By what process did speakers replace a word as deeply embedded as &quot;not&quot;? (4) Why should they have done so?? </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b>For three decades, my scholarly work has focused on Holocaust survivor memoirs, including more recently ? ? memoirs of the second generation, specifically the sub-genre &ldquo;from mother to daughter.&rdquo; In 2009, I self-published a memoir, entitled (Re)vision of a Life: My Mother&rsquo;s Holocaust Story, about my mother&rsquo;s Holocaust experiences as well as her life in Germany before the Holocaust and her life afterward in the United States.??<br />
           <br />
           These memories and stories had been shared with me when I was a child and repeated often as I grew into adulthood. The question that scholar Eva Tal poses?how much should we tell the children??is at the heart of the continuing discussion about Holocaust literature for children, my current scholarly focus. Her question suggests some additional questions that this presentation will pose and attempt to answer: What types of Holocaust literature are available for children? What determines age-appropriateness for such literature? How can children&rsquo;s literature about the Holocaust?whether fiction or non-fiction?remain true to the historical context while also being sensitive to the intellectual, psychological, and emotional development of children???</p>

The Predatory State rose through violence to define itself, dominate its internal populations, and wage war on others. Conquest Christianity, joined by Conquest Democracy, has provided the justification for the ideological transformation of exploitation into acts of kindness. Liberated Capitalism, the profit motive without effective checks on its destructive tendencies, has turned both humanity and the earth itself into factors of production. Unleashed Individualism and Misapplied Technology have multiplied the power of the Predatory State and Liberated Capitalism to wreak havoc on Nature and society. The contemporary crisis of the American subsystems of politics, economics, education, health care, culture and environment are a consequence of these rampaging five horsemen that must be redirected to constructive ends for the good of humanity and the earth.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b>As an inter-disciplinary group with backgrounds in language, literature, culture, anthropology and instructional technology we are developing an application (or app) that will inform students, scholars and community members about the cultural, linguistics, and historical background of different landmarks in Detroit.<br />
           ?<br />
           The &quot;Layars&quot; app is an &quot;augmented reality platform&quot;, that allows users to interact with points of interest within a larger environment. When scanning an environment with a smartphone or tablet computer, users can gather detailed contextual information about individual features within it. This contextual information - or in our case, cultural &quot;layers&quot;, can be packaged in a combination of visual, textual, or audio formats - permitting a multimedia, multivocal, and diachronic engagement with a particular place. Layars has recently been used as a platform for cultural heritage, tourism, and community mapping in several cities in the U.S.<br />
           ?<br />
           We propose to develop the Detroit Layars app focused on ethnic neighborhoods in Detroit. In this session we will begin with a project overview, visit the German Traces of New York City upon which our project is modeled, and then present plans for our pilot. We will discuss places of interest that will be included in our pilot and possibilities for inter-disciplinary collaboration and partnerships with other organizations.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b>In?<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT73_com_zimbra_date"><span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT74_com_zimbra_date">June 1959</span></span>, the so-called &ldquo;kitchen debate&rdquo; between Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was hailed in American news reports as a victory not only for Nixon, but for the consumerist way of life. Nixon&rsquo;s political star rose on the basis of his perceived tough stance against communism, as he and Khrushchev vehemently disagreed at every moment of the debate?except one. This talk focuses on a little-noticed moment of agreement as the two world leaders paused before the RCA-Whirlpool &ldquo;Miracle Kitchen of the Future,&rdquo; a display enhanced by an array of technological gadgets and young women modeling bathing suits. Duly reported in the New York Times transcript of the event, but as an &ldquo;interruption,&rdquo; this moment of levity suggests that the conceptual link between sex and technology was as salient as Marshall McLuhan had argued it was, and not only in capitalist consumer systems. It also demonstrates the critical role of women to both economies and suggests that though those roles differed in important respects, they were united in their reliance on the technical automation of the &ldquo;wifely&rdquo; role.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> In 2011, the head of the International Monetary Fund and French socialist politician, Dominique Strauss-Kahn (DSK), was taken from a plane and placed under arrest, accused of sexually assaulting a hotel worker. While he was subsequently released, the high drama of the DSK scandal, and the later accusations of prior sexual assaults, sex parties, and even procurement, seem less significant now than they did then, but revisiting the drama, and unwinding its various skeins, tells us something about immigration and sexual politics, international banking and European politics, and the culture of "exposure" that is contemporary mass media politics. Perhaps it also is a way of addressing our resilient--if na?ve--belief in the possibility of finding and understanding "exactly what happened" in a culture that values the appearance of truth at the same time it demeans its revelation. Most of all, it reveals to us our own deep distrust of those who are "Other" in our world, both those who live on its margins, as did Nafissatou Diallo from Guinea, and Dominque Strauss-Kahn himself, born in the French elite and a socialist intellectual and politician.</p>

Their  presentation will discuss the use of visual metaphors, perception, usability,  learning theories, information design principles, and visual hierarchy and how  these things affect the way that people create meaning from their physical  experiences and develop semiological systems to encode and communicate those  experiences. The visualization of information is about relationships ? the  grouping, flow, and pacing of information ? and Moldenhauer, Nathan, and  Spannaus have been, with the assistance of the WSU Registrar, re-working the Add  and Override Approval form to focus on how of both words and visual elements  can shape the ability of people to navigate information and perform specific  tasks. The collaborators discovered that there were many layers of  interpretation required and challenges to understanding the sequence of steps ?  who does what and when ?? required to complete the form.

            <b>Abstract:</b>Charlotte Elizabeth Wilder (1898-1980) was an  award-winning modernist poet with two published volumes and many individual  poem publications when she experienced a schizophrenic break in February 1941  and entered hospitals, with a brief period of freedom in the early 1950s, for  the rest of her life.? Wilder's poetry  holds interest for her engagement with themes of sexuality, her formal  innovations, and for her near-invisibility after the onset of her  hospitalization and subsequent disability from psychological treatments,  including a prefrontal lobotomy. Her poetry and biography are equally  compelling. I will discuss specific issues that have arisen in editing the  archive of a writer who was often separated from her papers and whose own  ambivalence about writing became pronounced. I'll also provide background about  the specific pressures she faced as one of a family of talented writers, and I  will share some of the newly edited poetry.</p>
