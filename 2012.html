<div class="titles">Explication</div>
<div id="text">
 <p>Since the election of President Barak Obama, the popular press has advanced the idea that the United States is now in a "post-racial" era. Yet this media construction may obscure actual race relations in society. For example, although the United States is becoming more diverse and multi-racial with increased Asian and Latino populations bringing their own cultural and racial diversity, national policies governing immigration and recent legislation in some states against Affirmative Action reflect continued resistance to racial diversity. </p>
<p> From a scholarly perspective, the idea of a "post-racial" era must be critically examined historically and socially. Perceptions about race and racism have always shifted temporally and spatially. Race has been operative in this nation since its inception, and aspirations to redraw the color-line, which W.E.B. Du Bois dubbed the project for the new 20th century, are hardly new and not the sole property of the US mass media. Race is a social construction, and so is the "post-racial" era. With these considerations in mind, can we say that America has reached the point where it can be truly post-racial? What are the global implications?</p><p>In addressing this question, we must consider that attitudes differ depending on one's class, as well as race, the latter complicated by recent redefinitions, such as "biracial," "multiracial," or even Tiger Woods' invention "Cablinaisan."</p><p>It is also likely that the term "post-racial" conceals as much as it reveals by announcing a new era, a radical change, betokened by the accession to the highest office of a new and different kind of leader. Yet who uses the term and for what purposes? What does it reflect (or ignore) about race, race relations and racial discriminations? Does post racial mean post racist? </p><p>What can intellectuals across the disciplines bring to an interrogation of "post" and "racial," terms that are both academic and widely used in the media? Is the "post" in post-racial the same as the post in "post-modern"? Is the "post" in post-racial the same as other postings that signify that time has moved beyond the past and that "master narratives" ? including the narrative that "race matters" -- are, for good or ill, past history?</p>

<p><b>Title: Racism, Discrimination, and the Illusion of Post-Racialism in Obamerica
</b><br />
Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Professor, Sociology<br />Duke University</p>
<p>Racism ended in American on November 4, 2008."  "We have a black President, so minority folks have no more excuses!"  "I'm so proud we finally got over our racial hump!" Expressions like these have become commonplace since Barack Obama became the first African American President of the United States. In this talk, Professor Bonilla-Silva will address four things to challenge the mantra of post-racialism. First, he will discuss briefly the meaning of racism as too many people think it is all about mere "prejudice." Second, he will examine the nature of America's racial regime since the 1970s and suggest that Jim Crow has been replaced by a new, more sophisticated system he labels the "new racism." Third, he will explain the "miracle of the election of Barack Obama and argue forcefully that this event was not evidence of America moving "beyond race." Lastly, he will articulate a political approach to deal with the upcoming election as well as with the "new racism.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Title: The more things change...</b><br />
Elvis Mitchell, Independent Film Critic, Host of the Public Radio Show, <em>The Treatment</em> &amp;<br />
Visiting Lecturer, Harvard University</p>

<p>With the media and social maelstrom around the Trayvon Martin case, it's impossible to not think of the scene in 'Menace II Society' in which the teacher says to his young black student: "the hunt is on, and you're the prey." It's a moment that reflected what the world was like then and now. Further, America's most exportable product is its culture. And while many inroads have been made in other areas, the representations of African Americans in films and TV has so stagnated that you couldn't even tell the U.S. has a black president from what is seen of us on the big and small screens. That is, when we are seen. Never has a point in African American culture been so much like Alphonse Karr's assessment and 
condemnation of his society: "plus ca change" It's these contradictions I'll seek to explore, and explain.

    <b>Menopause and Midlife in Detroit:  Uncovering Race-based Contexts for Women's Experiences</b><br />
           	Heather Dillaway, Associate Professor &amp; Interim Chair, Sociology
           	 
             <p>(<a class="normalA" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExIAt8y2kXk&list=PL0C80675D1AAD4F97&index=3&feature=plpp_video" target="_new">Video</a>)</p>
             
              <p>After ten years and 130-in-depth interviews with menopausal women, I am beginning to realize exactly how important menopause and other midlife experiences can be for individual women. As I listen to women's narratives, I become more aware of the local, race-based contexts for women's experiences of menopause. I also realize that the data I gather on women's midlife identities, broadly speaking, are just as important as any data I gather on menopause specifically, and that midlife identities are also inscribed by race within a Detroit context. The premise that my study starts with, then, is that race does still determine individuals' life chances and outcomes. I also argue that race-based attitudes and experiences can still be found in empirical data and that these data cannot be explained away by other factors besides race. This is particularly true when one studies individuals in particular settings. For instance, Detroit is still one of the most racially segregated cities in the U.S. Due to demographic forces, aging African American women comprise a considerable presence in the Detroit metropolitan community and should be studied.

    <b>Liking, Likeness and the Color-Line in Andy Warhol</b><br />Jonathan Flatley, Associate Professor, English<p>(<a class="normalA" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ1zqvK8Oe0&list=PL0C80675D1AAD4F97&index=2&feature=plpp_video" target="_new">Video</a>)</p>

<p>
"Liking, Likeness and the Color-Line in Andy Warhol."  This essay will serve as the final chapter of my book manuscript, Like: Andy Warhol and Affectivity, which examines the relationship between likeness and liking in Warhol's work.  The chapter analyzes Warhol's representation of race and racialization in relation to his famous assertions in a November 1963 interview that "everybody should like everybody," and that "Pop art is liking things." As Warhol's play with alternate meanings of "like" in the interview suggests, "liking" for Warhol rests upon the ability to perceive and produce likeness.  This likeness, or similarity, is both conceptually and experientially distinct from sameness; to "be alike" is to be related, but distinct, neither identical nor incommensurate.  When Warhol articulated this insistence on likeness and pursuit of liking in this 1963 interview, most readers would have understood his utterance in relation to the forms of dislike and assertions of dissimilarity that surrounded the civil rights movement, which in 1963 had seen a great deal of publicity around events such as police violence against protesters in Birmingham, photos of which were the source material for Warhol's Race Riot paintings of the same year.  </p>
<p>

Reified categories of racial difference of course played a crucial role in legitimizing this violence. "Liking, Likeness and the Color-Line" will argue that Warhol's response to the multifarious and aggressive ideological foregrounding of incommensurable difference was to recall to us our capacity for perceiving and producing similarities, including and especially across the color line.   I will make this case through an examination of several works from different periods in Warhol's career that directly address the problem of the color line in a specific historical context: the above mentioned Race Riot paintings and the film Kiss (both 1963), Warhol's 1975 series of paintings and prints of African-American and Latino drag queens, Ladies and Gentlemen, and his 1984-5 collaborations with the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat.

    <b>More or Less White:  Mestizo Identities and "Post-Racial" Multiculturalism in Ecuador</b><br />Barry Lyons, Associate Professor, Anthropology<p>(<a class="normalA" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pk0J8uXeho&list=PL0C80675D1AAD4F97&index=1&feature=plpp_video" target="_new">Video</a>)</p>

<p>
For the last several years, I have been researching the impact of the Indian movement and multiculturalism in 
Ecuador on non-Indian Ecuadorians' understandings of race and ethnicity.  As in many places around the world, Ecuador has seen a shift from overtly racial notions of difference to an (apparently) 'post-racial' discourse focused on cultural difference, ethnicity, and multiculturalism.  My project focuses on school teachers working with Indian children under an intercultural bilingual (Spanish-Kichwa) education program, as well as teachers working in mixed classrooms of children under the traditional, mestizo-dominated education bureaucracy.  The Humanities Center Faculty 
Fellowship will support travel to Ecuador in summer 2012, during which I will discuss my analysis and manuscript drafts with Ecuadorian scholars, Indian activists, and research participants prior to final revisions.</p>

    <b>The Constructions (and Deconstructions) of Whiteness in "Post-Racial" America</b>
<br />             	Fran Shor, Professor, History<p>(<a class="normalA" href="11-12/The Constructions.pdf" target="_new">Handout</a>)</p>
<p>
The ideological drive to obscure the persistence of white racial privilege in contemporary America is part of a 
contested terrain of discursive practices and political projects. As noted by the authors of Whitewashing Race, "formal 
equality before the law coexists with de-facto white privilege and whites' resentment of race-conscious remedies" (Brown, et. Al. 30). Identifying and analyzing the constructions of whiteness in a so-called "post racial" America will be the focus of this project. Specifically, I want to examine what I tentatively suggest are the three contending ideological tropes that have emerged in the political culture of the United States in the last several decades. They fundamentally occupy the discursive terrain represented in the following ideological continuum: 1) a conservative backlash as 
"defensive" whiteness; 2) a neoliberal agenda as "colorblind" whiteness; and 3) a color-conscious whiteness reflected in the variety of anti-racist theory and practice. </p>

    <b>Multimodal "Post-Racial" Discourses of Slavery and Freedom in Marilyn Nelson's Fortune's Bones:  The Manumission Requiem</b><br />Ebony E. Thomas, Assistant Professor, Education

<p>
Marilyn Nelson's award-winning illustrated book of poetry for children, Fortune's Bones:  The Manumission Requiem, features the haunting true account of an African American man enslaved by a physician in eighteenth-century New England (Nelson).  When Fortune died in 1798, the physician rendered his skeleton for the purposes of his research at the School of Anatomy in Waterbury, Connecticut.  Although records show that Fortune was married and the father of several children at the time, as enslaved people, his family had no burial rights.  Fortune's skeletal remains were studied by several generations of New England physicians.  By the twentieth century, Fortune's name was lost, but his bones were used in a popular museum exhibit.  
</p><p>
After the Civil Rights Movement, the skeleton became a rich resource for scholars and researchers interested in the lives of African Americans during slavery, and a perennial source for social and cultural debate.   Marilyn Nelson works in this post-Civil Rights tradition, animating Fortune and his contemporaries' voices and identities by appropriating the trope of the Requiem mass.  Nelson's "manumission requiem" was set to music by Sweet Honey in the Rock 
composer Ysaye Barnwell in 2008, and has been performed by the Waterbury Symphony Orchestra.  Thus, the 
lifeworld of Fortune has been recently reconstructed across the multiple textual modes of a museum exhibit for 
general audiences, a picture book intended for older children and young adults, and a symphony for lovers of 
classical music.  In each of these retellings, different aspects of Fortune's life, death, and posthumous legacy are salient.  As this year's call reminds us that "perceptions about race and racism have always shifted temporally and spatially," my intent is to connect the past to the present by interrogating the echoes of collective trauma in Fortune's Bones and related postmodern historical recounts of slavery that are presented to children and young adults in the early twenty-first century (Byerman; Eyerman; Huyssen; Lyotard).  For just as our perceptions of race and "post-race" are socially constructed, so, too are our notions about the institution of slavery in the United States.  Indeed, each successive generation of Americans has reconciled the paradox of America as both "land of the free" and "home of the slave" through competing metanarratives (Lyotard; Thomas).  As most people are introduced to this reconciliation as schoolchildren, texts such as Fortune's Bones provide not only a window into the past, but a snapshot into our 
supposed "post-racial" era. 
</p><p>
As Canadian scholar Shaobo Xie noted ten years ago in Voices of the Other:  Children's Literature in the 
Postcolonial Context, "Children are perhaps the most victimized and most urgently need to be postcolonized, not so much because they are the most colonized as because they are most violently subjected to colonialist ideas of Otherness at the most formative years of their life" (Xie).  Although children's texts remain an undertheorized and undervalued field of scholarship in English literary studies, critique of books, films, magazines, websites, comics, and graphic novels intended for children is indeed one of the most effective postcolonial and critical projects in the long run, for "the world ultimately belongs to children."  As Fortune's Bones is based upon a museum exhibit, alongside the text itself, this project will also examine the ways that museum culture represents (and fictionalizes, and 
sanitizes) history for children and the general public.  This research will provide a knowledge base for literary 
criticism and scholarship, and theoretical framework for exploring visual and multimodal texts alongside traditional selections from critical and postmodern perspectives.

    <b>After the Lynching Show</b> <br />Kidada E. Williams, Assistant Professor, History<p>(<a class="normalA" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6PKF2umYuo&list=PL0C80675D1AAD4F97&index=4&feature=plpp_video" target="_new">Video</a>)

<p>
After the Lynchng Show will be the first book-length project to explore American collective memory of lynching and racial violence in the wake of the exhibition "Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America" which traveled across the country from 2000-2008. This project seeks to re-examine assumptions that champions of Without 
Sanctuary made about the cultural, educational, and social benefits of displaying lynching photography and will offer an analysis of the different ways Americans engage the history of lynching and racial violence as a result of the 
exhibit. The concept "post-racial", as reflected in its usage in the American lexicon, presumes that because the 
United States has engaged in some symbolic initiatives to acknowledge the harm done to African Americans and the nation by slavery, convict-leasing, segregation, lynching, and racial violence that the nation has repaired the harm done and therefore achieved racial reconciliation. The preliminary hypothesis for this project, as it relates to the 
post-racial theme, is that regarding lynching and racial violence, these reconciliation initiatives did not illuminate the effects of this violence on the mostly African American victims and the ways this violence forever altered the ways that black and whites interact with each other. Specifically, displaying lynching photographs and publishing articles and books on lynching and racial violence did not help Americans understand black people's perspectives on this violence, the relationship between this violence and white privilege and black subjugation and lingering interracial strife. </p>
