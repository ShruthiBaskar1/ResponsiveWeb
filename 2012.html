<h3>Explication</h3>
<div id="text">
  <div id="text3">
    <p>A focal point for the apocalyptic imagination in much popular discourse, the year 2012 provides an appropriate occasion to consider the way the idea of apocalypse functions within and informs our collective historical imagination. Numerous politicians, writers, religious groups, as well as works of literature, film, and the culture industry in general now regularly deploy imagery of cataclysmic destruction and the end-of-the-world. This symposium will explore a variety of inter-related issues in order to theorize and historicize the persistent fascination with apocalypse. We invite papers that examine the apocalyptic imaginary as related to topics including but not limited to the following: the "end of days" and popular fiction; religion and theology; disaster capitalism; economic, financial, and technological meltdown; global warming; disease and pestilence; media, war, terror, environment, millennial fantasies, and effects of apocalypse on political thought and organization. </p>

    <p><strong><center>Douglas Kellner<br />University of California, Los Angeles<br /><em>"Apocalyptic Imagination in contemporary Hollywood Cinema"</em></center></strong><br /><br />
    
    <b>Abstract</b>
   <br /> In my book Cinema Wars (Blackwells 2010), I discuss a cinema of apocalypse that envisages cataclysmic environmental destruction, social catastrophes through war and destruction, and apocalyptic end-of-the-world scenarios. I argue that these films articulate an imaginary of fear in the contemporary era and mobilize anxieties about specific social problems like economic crisis, loss of jobs, family, and homes and deterioration of the environment, cities, and public spaces. I will discuss specific popular films like Children of Men, the films of George Romero and other zombie spectacles, The Avengers, and other popular spectacles of apocalypse. I will attempt to analyze what these films tell us about contemporary US and global society and the need for critical media literacy to decode popular artifacts which articulate contemporary anxieties and ideologies.
<br /><br />
<b>Biography</b> 
<br />Douglas Kellner is a "third generation" critical theorist in the tradition of the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. Kellner was an early theorist of the field of critical media literacy and has been a leading theorist of media culture generally. In his recent work, he has increasingly argued that media culture has become dominated by the forms of spectacle and mega-spectacle. He also has contributed important studies of alter-globalization processes, and has always been concerned with counter-hegemonic movements and alternative cultural expressions in the name of a more radically democratic society.
<br /><br />
Kellner has written with a number of authors, including an award-winning trilogy of books on postmodern turns in philosophy, the arts, and in science and technology. More recently, he is known for his work exploring the politically oppositional potentials of new media and attempted to delineate what they term "multiple technoliteracies" as a movement away from the present attempt to standardize a corporatist form of computer literacy.

    <strong><em>"Cold Comfort: Global Climate Change, Disaster Capitalism and Apocalyptic Cinema"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  Julian Cornell<br />

<br />
           	  
           	   
  <p>This paper will contrast roundly pilloried disaster films ? The Day After Tomorrow and Waterworld -- and the acclaimed documentary An Inconvenient Truth. All three films serve to delineate societal anxieties regarding the confluence of climate change and neoliberalism, configuring them as contemporary iterations of Biblical apocalypses and circumscribing them within a familiar, comforting template. Despite overt dissimilarities, the films emerge as paradigmatic disaster fictions, fulfilling the apocalyptic form's longstanding function as sense-making system through which historical events are filtered to discern their metaphorical significance. Such symbolic engagement with social crises through spectacles of destruction makes it possible to see apocalyptic narratives as political allegories. The transition from the requirements of the traditional apocalyptic tale, offering succor to the oppressed, to the conditions of the mass marketplace, demanding broad appeal and acknowledging hegemonic ideologies, engenders dialectical tensions between destruction and salvation, between history and its allegory.  While simultaneously articulating a hope for a better future, and expressing a sense of despair regarding remedial social action, these films express deep dissatisfaction with free market ideology and contemporary geopolitics, while simultaneously affirming the very Social Darwinism and/or American values that sustain such formations. </p>

    <strong><em>"Queer Green Apocalypse: Tony Kushner's Angels in America"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  Katie Hogan<br />
Carlow University</b>
<br />
           	  
           	   
  <p>Tony Kushner's commitment to linking environmental deterioration, AIDS, and gay identity is prominent in his sprawling, lively, capacious play, Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes.  Angels includes environmental degradations such as global warming, the torn ozone layer, radon gas, Chernobyl, irridium in hot dogs, fluorocarbons in refrigerators, and a right-wing legal ruling on the environment?one based in the case of two women whose children were being blinded by smoke from a tooth-paste factory. These environmental citations are intertwined with rampant racism, homophobia, and the shameful mistreatment of people with AIDS, creating a queer ecological interconnectedness that characterizes the play's style and politics. </p><p>
	In contrast to Kushner's queer use of apocalypse is Family Radio founder Harold Camping and his followers, who view queer culture as the greatest evidence of social decline. As Camping argues, same-sex marriage and the gay movement are God's deliberate signs of the impending rapture and apocalypse. The "rapture" story around which Harold Camping's May 21 and October 21, 2011 doomsday language is organized uses apocalypse against queer citizens and the earth, and the focus is on departing the earth and targeting LGBT people as poisonous elements that must be purged through the earth's destruction. </p><p>
	This paper uses a queer ecofeminist interpretation of the play in order to examine Kushner's "queering" of the apocalyptic genre?a method that symbolizes his commitment to environmental concerns, to salvaging and healing the planet, and to debunking the ancient idea that LGBTs are "against nature." Angels specifically modifies left-oriented 1970s environmental crisis rhetoric and religious fundamentalist homophobic uses of the apocalyptic imaginary in order to enact a "reverse apocalypse"?or "queer" rapture?on behalf of queers, ecofeminist politics, and marginalized people and the planet.

  <p>! most powerful master metaphor that the contemporary environmental imagination has at its disposal." He justifies the use of this metaphor as a means of provoking action in order to forestall actual collapse. Planting this type of nightmare in the public consciousness has helped to avert environmental disaster in the past. Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, for example, was instrumental in banning DDT. Of course, Carson's warning of ecological collapse pivoted predominantly on the problem of pesticide use, providing her with (more or less) a clear villain to fight. In contrast, our modern sense of environmental doom is tightly interwoven with the social fabric of global cultures: the capitalist paradigm of unending consumption, an addiction to fossil fuels, a dependency on globalism, a vastly unequal distribution of global resources, and so on. !	In the face of overwhelming concern, does an apocalyptic deadline actually help to motivate environmental change or does it merely reinforce social malaise, environmental complacency and denial? This paper will examine Lars Von Trier's recent apocalyptic film, Melancholia (2011), as a representation of modern environmental despair. It will offer an ecocritical analysis of the film and consider what function the film could play in shaping environmental attitudes and practices. The paper will draw on the apocalyptic and millennial theory of Lee Quinby, Catherine Keller and Robert Jay Lifton, as well as the writing of environmental theorists, such as Cate Sandilands who has examined melancholia in environmental thought. </p>

    <strong><em>"The Legacy of 9/11:  Analyzing the Television Programming of the "Apocalyptic Decade"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b> Melissa Ames<br />

<br />
           	  
           	   
  <p>That the much anticipated year of 2012 follows almost immediately after the ten year anniversary of the September 11th attacks is, of course, a coincidence.  However, that the two events are temporally aligned is not unimportant.  Although previous dates have sparked mass paranoia concerning the end of the world (e.g. the millennial Y2K scare), in many ways the decade following 9/11 especially predisposed American citizens to "feel" a certain way and more easily buy into the rhetoric surrounding the year 2012.  In fact, the extended decade spanning from September 11th, 2001 (the terrorist attacks) to December 21st, 2012 (the so-called "end date") might aptly be titled the "apocalyptic decade."  This presentation studies the television programming of the past eleven years through the lens of affect theory, showcasing how televisual narratives trace (and to help explain) this turn to the "apocalyptic."</p><p>

This essay highlights how the events of 9/11 have been "remediated" (replayed, repackaged, and revisited) in contemporary programming. This discussion focuses on how certain televisual genres responded to the national attack both immediately and years after (e.g. the news industry with their quasi-apocalyptic domestic doomsday predictions); how the post-9/11 climate contributed to the rise of certain genres (e.g. infotainment programming such as Comedy Central's The Daily Show which served as a counter narrative to the mainstream news and the reality television genre which provided escapist relief from such content); and how the thematic concerns surrounding 9/11 influenced the fictional programming of the past eleven years (e.g. the wave of "rescue" programming ? 24, Alias, The Unit, Lost ? and the revitalized popularity of "dystopian" narratives ? Heroes, FlashForward, Fringe, The Event).</p><p>
These trends indicate that larger cultural or generational climates (structures of feeling) influence the television programming of any given epoch.  In short, this essay claims that there is an important reciprocity at play between collective (national) affectual states and textual production/reception.  This reciprocity helps to explain the proliferation of apocalypse-inspired narratives that have surfaced throughout the past decade and the overall "culture of fear" that has surrounded them.

    <strong><em>"Reading the Performance of Sadomasochism against the Apocalyptic Backdrop"</em></strong><br />

  <p>The apocalypse is a backdrop to science fiction's staging of the erotohistoriographic performance of sadomasochism.  Elizabeth Freeman, in Time Binds, argues that "it is inescapably true that the body in sadomasochistic ritual becomes a means of invoking history?personal pasts, collective suffering, and quotidian forms of injustice?in an idiom of pleasure.   If in the foreground sadomasochism stages a collective history, then what role does the apocalypse play in the background? By historicizing the apocalypse in the context of erotic science fiction like that of Samuel R. Delany and Pat Califia, I think specifically about the post-apocalyptic settings of their novels, and then question the necessity of an end-of-days setting for representing queer sexualities. Delany's experimentation with gender, sexuality and temporality as performances of history in Stars in My Pocket like Grains of Sand is part of a genealogy of SM discourse in the 1980s and 1990s. Likewise, Califia's fiction, including Doc and Fluff, and non-fiction on sadomasochism are a key part of that discourse.  By comparing authors who foreground erotohistoriographic fantasy, I argue that the experimentation with gender and sexuality in contemporary erotic fiction performs the temporality of masochism against the backdrop of the apocalypse. </p>

  <p>This essay focuses on the co-option of apocalyptic vernacular rhetoric utilized by online apocalyptic communities by the Vivos Group Corporation, operators of a network of underground survival shelters. Vernacular rhetoric serves to maintain the ideology of online apocalyptic communities by not allowing for disagreement in interpretation within central tenants of the community ideology.  An analysis of tweets concerning current events from the Vivos Group's three Twitter feeds suggests the company co-opts the closed approach towards apocalypse ideology and the vernacular rhetoric of online apocalypse identified communities. In appropriating the vernacular of online apocalyptic communities, Vivos also utilizes the traditional Christian apocalyptic narrative as a selling method. Within the Christian apocalyptic narrative structure, Vivos rhetorically frames itself as a savior-like figure and its audience of potential shelter buyers as chosen survivors.</p><p>

Through rhetorically reinforcing an eschatological worldview based in a traditional religious narrative including an artificial Rapture, Vivos constructs a sense of agency in audience members restricted to the decision to purchase a shelter from Vivos.  As social networking tools like Twitter continue to grow in influence, future research would do well to recognize how organizations co-opt community vernacular, such as religious and apocalyptic rhetoric, for use as a persuasive strategy.

  <p>An often overlooked feature of dystopian or apocalyptic works is the function of realism.  From Darko Suvin's Positions and Suppositions in Science Fiction to Keith Booker's The Dystopian Impulse in Modern Literature, critics of dystopian literature primarily focus on the genre features of "estrangement" or "defamiliarization" that serve to construct distant or alternative universes to the author's own world.  However, the socio-political and economic climates of the 1970s and 1980s galvanized writers and musicians as diverse as J.G. Ballard to punk instigators the Sex Pistols to engineer a new kind of realist expression to actualize traditional dystopian and apocalyptic themes into the everyday.  In this paper, I will argue that the ingredients of worsening socioeconomic conditions, the advent of the Falklands War, and the mounting hysteria surrounding nuclear war tensions instigated a widespread explosion of artistic reworkings of the apocalypse in the social imagination.  In particular, I will discuss how British post-punk music can be understood as a specific expression of a realist, apocalyptic imagination that finds ultimate display in Threads (1984), a British TV drama about nuclear holocaust that literalized dystopic, apocalyptic themes into a refashioned kitchen-sink realism to stimulate social awareness about the dangers of brinkmanship politics and the new Tory right under Margaret Thatcher.</p>

  <p>William Godwin's last published work, The Lives of the Necromancers (1834) has been generally read as either a straightforward encyclopedia of reputed magicians and alchemists or a rationalist commentary on "the credulity of the human mind" in pre-Enlightenment Europe.</p><p>

In this paper, I read the Lives as apocalyptic literature.  Taking as a starting point his daughter Mary Shelley's The Last Man (1826), which depicts a global plague that annihilates all but one human life, I argue that Godwin's Lives is an attempt to inscribe counterfactual forms of knowledge within an increasingly monolithic public discourse.  As a remnant of both the rationalist energies of the late 18th-century and the high romanticism of the early 19th, Godwin is, in many respects, a "last man," whose survival is linked to this narrative of magical acts.  Drawing on Sara Guyer's work on testimony and Romanticism as well as Giorgio Agamben's philosophical work on "bare" or "naked" life, I contend that Lives posits apocalypse as a fundamental feature of historical progress, one which may be countered throught the alchemy of imagination.

  <p>My presentation discusses the role that eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century British travel writing played in shaping modern post-apocalyptic literature as a genre.  For eighteenth-century British travel writers and historians, the ruins of the Classical world and the Orient confirmed not only Britain's status as the historical apex of civilization, but also its destiny as a revitalizer of decrepit colonial lands.  When the post-apocalyptic genre first emerged during the latter half of the British Romantic period, texts like Anna Barbauld's poem, "Eighteen Hundred and Eleven" (1812), and Mary Shelley's novel, The Last Man (1826), consciously drew upon contemporary travel writing and the aesthetics of ruin-gazing found therein.  However, these appropriations subvert the typical ideological implications of ruin-gazing.  By depicting post-apocalyptic travelers' encounters with uncanny scenes of ruin and desolation within Britain itself, these early post-apocalyptic texts compelled readers to view their homeland as they would some distant colonial landscape.  The unexpected presentation of the homeland as the object of ruin-gazing in turn necessitates a reassessment of Britain, its current domestic situation, and its place in the world.  This function of the post-apocalyptic continues today in novels like The Road, films like 2012, and television shows like Life after People, which use travel or sightseeing as a central trope.</p>

  <p>Work, in apocalyptic and post apocalyptic fiction, no longer exists - at least in the way it did before the end of civilization. What then emerge in the fiction are depictions of human energy being used for the purpose of survival. Thus, the vernacular of work in these fictions implies the direct correlation between exerted human energy (labor) and consumption of items constructed from discarded material or found (subsistence). Such articulations suggest that work in the present stage of civilization does not function in that capacity. The question that emerges, then, is if the current vernacular of work fails to show the direct correlation between work and subsistence, what exactly is the vocabulary of work in this current stage of civilization? In other words, how is work defined? Moreover, what does the genre of apocalyptic fiction tells us about our vernacular of work? In my paper, I examine McCarthy's The Road and Butler's Parable of the Sower to explore these questions.  Both novels provide fruitful landscapes to examine new meanings and understandings that materialize with the imaginings of the absence of work.  Such imaginings in a time when work is in crisis suggest a need for new considerations of the vernacular of work.  </p>

  <p>Addressed to seven cities of Asia Minor, warning of a dangerous Babylon, and promising a New Jerusalem, the Book of Revelation is replete with urban imagery. And some of history's most dramatic millenarian movements have taken place in cities: Savonarola's Florence, the Anabaptist takeover of sixteenth-century M?nster, radical groups in the English Civil War. More recently, new religious groups?such as Mormonism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and Pentecostalism?have either urban origins or aspirations. Despite a few pioneering efforts, historians of apocalyptic belief have not focused on the correlation between the apocalyptic imagination and the rise of cities. Does an urban environment affect the character of apocalyptic belief and millennial activity? Can an apocalyptic belief system address specific urban concerns or values? What, if anything, do historical examples suggest about trajectories for the apocalyptic imagination in world that is now more than half urban?Using examples from Western Europe and North America, this paper will explore the interrelationship between apocalyptic belief and the urban environment. Through the prism of urban life and values, the paper will examine a continuum of apocalyptic belief and action, not simply radical millenarian movements, but also those new sects (Mormonism, Pentecostalism) and millennial fringe groups (the People's Temple, Heaven's Gate) that have either grown up in or made their homes in cities. </p>

  <p>If the parallel between political organizations and bodies is commonplace since Antiquity, and if the sovereign body identifies itself with a Leviathan in authoritarian times, can also the apocalyptic dissolution of the State also be equated to a rotting social body? And to what extent does the specific imagination of dystopian and/or post-apocalyptic body cultures (including enslaved, sexually reified and post-human bodies) mirror the collapse of the social body on a wider scale?</p><p>
In my paper, I will apply these research questions to the field of contemporary Italian fiction, marked by an increasing interest in post-apocalyptic and dystopian narrative. It is my contention that Italian culture, obsessed by its own "anomaly" (Carrera 2011; Luisetti 2010) and haunted by a politics of obscenity, provides an exemplary case for understanding this key issue. Indeed, the politics of obscenity (with specific reference to the ostentation of Berlusconi's body) is one of the features that Slavoj Zizek has listed among the signs of apocalyptic thinking in his Living in the End Times (2010), in a mounting spiral of ideological regression. </p><p>
I will examine a corpus of post-apocalyptic novels published in Italy during the 2000-2011 decade: Laura Pugno's Sirene [Mermaids] (2008), Davide Longo's L'Uomo verticale [The Vertical man] (2010); Tommaso Pincio's Cinacitt? [China-Town] (2008), Wu Ming 5's Free Karma Food, and two short stories by the collective author Wu Ming, "Arzestula" (2009) and "Pantegane e sangue" (2000). In these works, regression expresses itself through the violation of fundamental taboos, leading to a false primitivism that is, in fact, an invention of our present. The crumbling reality of our financial economies is thus replaced by a universal economy of rape and cannibalism (often deriving from a problematic definition of what is human, in a context of genetic mutations, unknown diseases and environmental disasters). Instead of providing a potential imagination for crisis scenarios, as most scholars are nowadays inclined to suggest (Paik 2010; Drezner 2011) the graphic violence of these catastrophic tales gestures at the collapse of our society: a "social corpse", closely recalling the swarming hordes of the undead or the mobs of cannibals ? humans only by name ? populating the new ruins of Rome.

  <p>Characters in representations of suburbia, in film as well as in fiction, typically share a chilling, almost paralyzing sensation of being left outside the passage time. Disconnected from the past as well as the future, indeed, from history itself, the suburbanite is in a perpetual state of limbo, marooned in a kind of anti-place where both roots are progress are rendered unattainable or at least strangely irrelevant. Rick Moody's novels The Ice Storm and Purple America explore suburbia as a post-historical phenomenon with the apocalyptic myth as narrative backdrop. In The Ice Storm, suburbia rushes towards its demise accompanied by escalating conflicts and portentous signs. The cataclysmic trajectory seems not only predetermined but also premeditated as the possibility of divine intent is suggested, if not established. In Purple America, by contrast, God is conspicuously absent and although the catastrophe has already occurred, the end somehow fails to arrive. This paper will read Moody's suburban landscapes as expressions of the apocalyptic imagination but also show how the novels represent widely different phases and facets of the apocalyptic myth.</p>
