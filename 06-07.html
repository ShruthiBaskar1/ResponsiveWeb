    <em>&ldquo;Affect,   Mediality, and Abu Ghraib&rdquo;</em><br />
  </em></strong></em>There is general agreement   that the photographs depicting torture and humiliation of Iraqi prisoners at Abu   Ghraib reveal actions by US soldiers that are completely beyond the pale of   acceptable civilized behavior. Most accounts of these photographs focus on the   symbolic or ideological nature of the photographs as representations of the   injustice, if not the obscenity, of the US prosecution of the war in Iraq and US   power generally. While not disagreeing with these accounts, I want to take a   look at another element of the photographs that has been minimized or   ignored--the way in which they produce an affective, bodily response that occurs   prior to, and is structurally independent of, their cognitive or ideological   import. The intensity of this response is heightened, I argue, not because the   acts depicted in the photographs are so alien from our everyday experience, but   because (among other reasons) the &quot;mediality&quot; of the photographs--the way in   which the images were captured and shared across global, digital media   networks--is of a piece with our own everyday experiences of digital   photography, emailing, and browsing the web.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;The American Revolution's First Victory: Ending   British Naval Impressment in North America, 1763-1769&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    Historians rarely include impressment, or forced service into the   British Royal Navy, among the great issues of the American Revolution such as   sovereignty, taxation, representation, and independence. Yet between the   Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Stamp Act Crisis of 1765 no other issue   caused as much protest and violent disturbance by American colonists against   British imperial officials. Moreover, after the American Revolution the   impressment of American sailors would return to be a leading cause of the War of   1812 between Britain and the United States. Why, then, didn&rsquo;t naval impressment   play a bigger role in causing the Revolution itself? This paper explores this   question by analyzing British naval logbooks, newspaper reports of riots in   American seaports, and the diary and legal papers of John Adams. These and other   sources point to a single conclusion: by 1769 American seamen and their maritime   communities had largely defeated their old nemesis, impressment. Professor   Brunsman will explain the importance of this victory and why it is often   overlooked by historians of the American Revolution. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Paces   and Patterns of Acculturation Among post-1990 Immigrants in   America&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    This presentation is an attempt to understand the   changing tone of integration from a one-way process of assimilation to a two-way   process of acculturation and reciprocal acculturation among post-1990 immigrants   to America. It predicts a change in the texture of the American social fabric in   light of this influx of immigrants who are different than their predecessors in   terms of race religion and ethnicity. Its findings indicate that though each of   the six diverse ethnic groups studied has its own pace and pattern of   integration, each meets the requirements of American pluralism.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;Mapping Interior Spaces: the Evolution of <U>The Sleeping</U>&rdquo;</em></strong><em><br />
      </em>In this brown bag, Caroline Maun   (Assistant Professor, Interdisciplinary Studies) will discuss the background and   genesis of her recent book of poetry The Sleeping (Marick Press, $14.95). The   poetry in the volume was composed during the previous five years, and like many   other poets, these poems stayed in folders or lived on the computer   indefinitely, awaiting plans for publication but mosly as a creative outlet.   After an opportunity to publish them arose with Marick Press, Maun discovered   she had over seventy poems and enough to fashion a solid volume. She will share   what she has learned from this experience about the writing process, what is   expected from a book of poetry, and the development of publicity for the book.   Copies will be available for purchase and the author will be available for   signing. <br />

    <em>&ldquo;Interactions between Race and Space: South Africa and   Detroit&rdquo;</em></strong><em><br />
    </em>The United States and South Africa share long   histories of black oppression by whites. The legacy of those histories include   enduring inequalities of income and education between blacks and whites and high   levels of residential segregation on the basis of color in the major cities in   both nations. Centers of employment are increasingly decentralized in both   places. Population density is low in South African cities as it is in Detroit   and other cities built out in the age of the automobile. </p>
  <p>Despite these similarities, American and South African cities are mirror   images of one another. Detroit exemplifies all too well the typical U.S. pattern   in which white flight left the urban core with large concentrations of black   residents while the suburban fringe is primarily white. In contrast, blacks in   South Africa were consistently kept out of the central city and black urban   residential areas were pushed to the periphery. The seminar will use a   comparison of Johannesburg and Detroit to explore the development of this   contrast and its implications.<br />

        <em>&ldquo;Scholarship Within Language Program   Direction&rdquo;<br />
        </em></strong>Language program directors (LPDs) may play many   roles in their departments: researchers, teachers, teacher supervisors and   trainers, curriculum and test developers, program administrators, human   resources directors, mediators, advisors, technology support staff, webmasters,   and so on. Despite the range of these roles, most LPDs are trained to conduct   their research solely or primarily within a branch of foreign languages such as   linguistics, literary studies, or cultural studies. While the questions asked   within these disciplines and the research methods used to answer them can be   quite varied, they do not necessarily address issues that are particular to   LPDs&rsquo; non-instructional roles. This paper explores some of the research   questions and methods used in other disciplines such as industrial and   organizational psychology, educational administration, and business management   that can enhance LPDs&rsquo; approaches to research. Input from attendees regarding   the applicability of these and other disciplines&rsquo; research models would be most   welcome. </p>

    </strong><strong><em>&ldquo;Possession at the Heart of   Land Use Law: A Behavioral Perspective&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    Explanations for land   use law usually rely on a Coasian justification or on the 5th and 14th   amendments of the United States Constitution. In this research, I will use   lessons from behavioral economics to discuss how psychology can help explain   land use law. In particular, I will explore how human tendencies to value losses   more than gains, &lsquo;loss aversion,&rsquo; and &lsquo;framing&rsquo; can explain land use   law.</p>
  Among the areas that I address in this research are takings, allowable   uses, subdivision exactions, and the absence of compensation by private   landowners to the public when government programs increase the value of   landowners&rsquo; property. I find that behavioral economics offers good explanations   for these laws and accompanying regulations. I acknowledge that traditional   economic explanations work well in some instances, for example, in the law of   eminent dom

    <em>&ldquo;Text/Trade/Technology: Constructing Print   Literacy in Eighteenth-Century England&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>This presentation will   examine the changing relationship between pedagogical reading and writing   wrought by new educational technologies in late eighteenth-century England.   Student writing in earlier period had been seen as a physical skill based in the   act and art of copying others&rsquo; text, beginning with individual letters and   moving to complete essays. This &ldquo;copy-writing&rdquo; worked through a set of specific   somatic techniques and technologies to literally internalize cultural norms and   ideals within the student body. In this context, reading was a process meant to   set off other processes, such as the oral production of knowledge through   recitation or the hand&rsquo;s role in the collection and reinscribing of text within   student commonplace books.</p>
  <p>Significant changes in the methods of literacy training, however, emerged in   the eighteenth century England not only from education theorists but from a   print trade eager to create a demand for educational books. Because of the   growing acceptance of a specifically print literacy that demanded no   interaction, the student reader began to be imagined as the subordinate member   of an hierarchal relationship, poised to absorb passively the superior mind of   the literary or scholarly author. The technology of the book thus suppressed the   student hand and voice and disaggregated reading and writing. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Reflections on Gambling in Detroit:   Humanistic Costs and Benefits&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>The vast bulk of studies of   gambling seek to measure two phenomena? The economic &ldquo;costs&rdquo; and &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; and   the incidence of &ldquo;problem&rdquo; or &ldquo;pathological&rdquo; gambling. In this talk, I wish to   sketch out some parameters of the humanistic impacts of gambling behavior and   the gambling life. Few observers doubt that gambling has been a persistent part   of &ldquo;American&rdquo; culture since the Founding, including the popular lotteries that   provided venture capital in the early Republic. Horse racing, which today will   be propped up in most states by so- called &ldquo;racinos,&rdquo; is another deep vein of   popular culture. What many find most surprising is the recent and nearly total   loss of influence of gambling prohibitionists. Although prohibitionists still   may wield the power of stigma against drugs and some victimless crimes, gambling   spreads like wildfire. Only two states, Utah and Hawaii, today have neither   legalized gambling nor lotteries. Native American gaming is spreading Chance and   Lady Fortune into remote areas of the nation.<br />
    <br />
    Worse, from the standpoint   of those concerned with new addictions and the fate of souls, may be the spread   of internet gambling. Those linked to the Web may gamble at work or home and I   doubt that the courts will be able to police this form of risk-taking. But, some   may ask, how do we as humanists distinguish internet or casino risk taking and   speculation from day trading and commodities brokerage? Does gambling really   accelerate and intensify appetites or contain and express them? <br />
    <br />
    Some   humanists have argued that gambling excursions, the buses packed with the silver   haired and lame, are hardly to be feared. The elderly, ought to be allowed their   penny and nickel slot machines. Their casino outings allow for unharmful and   cheap thrills. On the other hand, many college administrators and professors,   having jettisoned in loco parentis in the dust some decades ago, now appear most   puzzled by the fervid appeal of &ldquo;Hold-Em&rdquo; poker. Jackson Lears, in his book   Something for Nothing, makes rather large claims for the necessity of appeals to   Chance and Fortune to counterbalance the increasing power of rational thought to   enclose modern life in its &ldquo;iron cage&rdquo;. <strong><em><br />

    <em>&ldquo;Constructing Post-Holocaust German   Identities in Israel/Palestine, 1946-2004 -- An Oral History   Project&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    This paper presents an overview of an oral history   project which examines an unexplored aspect of post-Holocaust German-Jewish   relations: the motivation for and experiences of non-Jewish or converted Germans   living temporarily or permanently in Israel/Palestine. <br />
    <br />
    The individual   motivations for and durations of living in Israel are diverse, ranging from   marriage and religion to study and volunteering; and from a few months to   several decades respectively. However, all of my interviewees (had to) reflect   on their collective identity of being German and not Jewish or converted in a   Jewish State or the Palestinian Areas and thus under Israeli occupation, on   German collective memory and on German/Jewish relations in a post-Holocaust   time. <br />
    This project is grounded in theories of individual and collective   memory and self-identity and contextualized in historical research on   post-Holocaust German-Jewish and German-Israeli relations. It employs oral   methodology, which will be integrated with the newly emerging genre of life   writing.<br />
    <br />
    Together with my interviewees I explored questions of   nationality, ethnicity and religion in our shared effort to understand what it   means to be a German in Israel today, and, more generally, what it means to be   German in a post-Holocaust age.<br />
    Since I was not interviewing an Other but   rather was in a similar subject position as my interviewees, a German Gentile in   Israel, my research is integrated with critical self-reflection on my own   motivations for doing the project.<br />

    The interview transcription cost and a   preliminary analysis of select interviews was generously funded in the Summer of   2005 by a Humanities Center Grant.</p>

    &ldquo;Franco Luambo Makiadi's Universalism&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    In this paper, I   take up the invocation of a cultural universal--that everyone should get   together to &quot;Stop AIDS!&quot;--in Franco Luambo Makiadi's Afro-pop tour de force <U>Attention na Sida</U>, perhaps the most brilliant public service announcement   ever made, a warning against AIDS that has been described as &ldquo;the most intense   16 minutes 37 seconds ever recorded, and the most courageous.&quot; Franco, who died   in 1989, most likely of causes related to the disease, was widely known as <U>le   grand ma?tre</U> of <U>rumba-soukous</U>, a cultural figure who achieved a scale   of recognition comparable to that of the major actors in the postcolonial   history of Congo/Za?re, from Kasavubu and Lumumba to Mobutu. Franco achieved   this recognition by means of a popular art that began with a synthesis of local   knowledge and imported idioms, defined a distinctive genre at a parallel moment   to national liberation, was redefined in conditions of exile and emigration, and   ended with a hybrid. global aesthetic articulated at the scale of a social   discourse. Due to historical conditions of reception, Franco&rsquo;s work is much less   known to Americans than it should be, particularly in comparison to the Nigerian   oppositional icon Fela, even while there is a consensus among historians of   Afro-pop of the enormous scale of Franco&rsquo;s influence. As a result of its form of   cultural innovation, <U>Attention na Sida</U> both intends and realizes a   poetics of universal address, written from a position of postcolonial   displacement, that allows us to reassess the status of universals through the   specifics of history, genre, and local knowledge.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;Friends' Religiosity and the Timing of First   Sex&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    A number of studies have found that more religious teens   have sex later than less religious adolescents.? Researchers have also found an   inverse relationship between friends&rsquo; attitudes and teens&rsquo; sexual behaviors.   However, little attention has been given to understanding the relationship   between friends&rsquo; religiosity and first sex.? Specifically, are adolescents   influenced by their friends&rsquo; religiosity ?that is, a socialization process? Or   do they sort into friendship groups on the basis of consistency between their   sex behaviors and the group&rsquo;s religious attitudes ?that is, a selection process?   Drawing on ideas from symbolic interactionism, I explain why we would expect   these relationships.? Using information from teens&rsquo; friends and data from the   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I test the   influence of friends&rsquo; religiosity on first sex, and the effect of virginity   status on moving to a more or less religious friendship group.? Net of   individual religiosity the association between friends&rsquo; religiosity and first   sex is reciprocal; effects operate in both directions.? I discuss how these   findings relate more generally to what we know about friendship group processes. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Franz Schubert and the Popular   Style&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    The most popular theatrical experience in Vienna during   the 18th and early 19th centuries was the folk comedy, whose origins date back   to at least the Middle Ages. Featuring magical plots, farcical situations, local   color, and improvised dialogue, this genre appealed to all classes of society.?   Although the popular comedy was often performed in humble settings and was at   times censored and even expelled from theaters, it continued to develop,   eventually merging with Viennese singspiel and later with German romantic   opera.</p>
  <p>Franz Schubert lived his entire life in and around Vienna, where he was a   choirboy and student, and later a freelance composer who longed for success with   stage music.? He is known to have attended performances of two farces at the   Leopoldst?dtertheater, the most important venue for popular comedy at the time.?   It is likely, however, that Schubert attended more performances and absorbed the   conventions and music of the popular theater into his personal style.? Some of   Schubert&rsquo;s early stage works reflect the unpretentious musical styles of the   popular stage, although these are sometimes juxtaposed against more   sophisticated idioms.? Later stage works, too, reveal influences from the   popular theater.? Even his mature instrumental works and lieder betray touches   of the popular style.</p>
  <p>This paper will provide a short history of Viennese popular comedy and   chronicle the role of music.? It will then focus on the influences of the   characters, situations, and musical styles of this genre on Schubert&rsquo;s music,   particularly on the stage works.</p>

    Nathaniel Bowditch came to maturity during the American   Revolution. Born and raised in Salem, MA, Bowditch was a self-educated   mathematical genius who sought to reform navigation by translating the   complicated calculations of chronometers, sextants, compasses, and maps into   reference tables that any sailor with a minimal training in math would be able   to read. His accomplishments were many, but his name still lives among ordinary   sailors as well as in the annals of international navigation because of his   tome?<em>Bowditch&rsquo;s New American Navigator</em>, dubbed the Bible of navigators.   Later in life, Bowditch spent most of his personal fortune on translating and   publishing LaPlace&rsquo;s <em>M?chanique c?leste</em>, then the most advanced book on   astronomy, &ldquo;for the benefit of my countrymen.&rdquo; My project is to bring to life   through experimental narration the life and times of this remarkable man, who   shaped concepts of American patriotism in a crucial period of nation building. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Personification in Dickens&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    Personification may   be viewed in various ways.? In this paper I mean by personification the   animating of inanimate things, particularly giving them human-like traits.?   Dickens uses this technique frequently in his writing.? My argument is that he   uses it consciously as a non-realistic mode of perception with the purpose of   retaining strict command of his narrative.? He emphasizes his own use of   personification, by employing the opposite device of de-animating human beings.?   Although Dickens can write in a realistic manner, this fanciful technique and   other devices keep him intentionally out of the realist camp.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;Technology as Surrogate: Mothers, Daughters and &lsquo;Labor-Saving&rsquo;   Devices&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    As Ruth Schwartz Cowan points out in More Work for   Mother, technologies created to do household tasks do not always reduce labor in   the home.? In fact, they often increase it by simultaneously increasing   standards of cleanliness, a result that Cowan maintains is (or was) purposeful.?   So-called &lsquo;labor-saving&rsquo; devices, she says, encouraged women&rsquo;s return to the   home at the end of World War II so that soldiers could take up what had been   &ldquo;men&rsquo;s&rdquo; jobs before the war created a labor crisis.? Other, specifically   feminist, work in technology studies maintains that women interact with   technologies differently than men do (see Machina ex Dea) or that technologies   affect women&rsquo;s lives differently than they do men&rsquo;s (Technology and Women&rsquo;s   Voices).</p>
  <p>Work on women&rsquo;s relationships with technology as a &ldquo;surrogate&rdquo; tends to   discuss reproductive technologies (see, for example, Women and Reproductive   Technologies).? This talk will consider technology literally as a surrogate for   human relationships, focusing primarily on the mother-daughter relationship in   the home as it is conducted through household technologies prior to the digital   age.? Drawing on work that claims technology increases the distance between   women?and other work that claims it brings women closer?I will suggest that when   household technologies brought women&rsquo;s work into the isolation of the home, they   fostered the development of a new, perhaps closer but not necessarily   harmonious, relationship between mothers and daughters.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;Eros in the   Classroom: Desire and Passion as Foundations of Teaching and   Learning&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    What do we think (or feel) when we hear the word   &ldquo;erotic&rdquo;?? Madonna?? Exotic dancing?? Cinemax late-night movies?? What do we   think (or feel) when we hear this word in the context of education?? To speak of   anything &ldquo;erotic&rdquo; in the classroom seems to bring nearly immediate discourse of   immorality.? In this lecture, I trouble that conceptualization of Eros, and   instead broaden the concept to include its historical roots in something more   contemporarily akin to &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;emotion.&rdquo;? I reclaim the concepts of Eros and   the erotic by reflecting on two notions of it: one within the confines of an   expanded notion of sexuality, and one broader conceptualization based on the   historical story of the god Eros and the Freudian notion of Eros.? I then argue   for a shift in pedagogical practice from resisting Eros as something immorally   sexual, to embracing Eros as an affirming, creative, and relationship-building   pedagogical necessity.? I conclude by offering the basic communication course   classroom as a prime context for embracing Eros and Eroticism.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;The Constitutional Protection of Religious Freedom and the   Religiosity of the American People&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    Religious freedom is a   favored value in the American constitutional system. It is the first guarantee   of the First Amendment, which begins with &ldquo;No law respecting the establishment   of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&rdquo;? The First Amendment   provides a two-fold protection to freedom of religion by what are referred to as   the &ldquo;religion clauses.&rdquo; The Establishment Clause protects against the   &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; of an official church by the government and against governmental   action &ldquo;establishing religion.&rdquo; It requires that the government maintain a   course of complete official neutrality toward religion. The government cannot   favor one religion over another religion or favor religion over non-religion,   such as by requiring prayer or bible reading in the public schools, or by using   public funds for religious purposes, The Free Exercise clause is a textual   guarantee of peoples&rsquo; right to practice their religion and to hold and act on   religious beliefs, free of governmental interference. It invalidates laws that   expressly discriminate against religion or against people because of their   religious beliefs, such as a law that disqualified members of the clergy from   serving as legislators, or a law that required a declaration of a belief in the   existence of God as a test for holding public office.</p>
  <p>The Establishment Clause has been the more important of the two clauses. The   underlying theory of the Establishment Clause is that prohibiting the government   from trying to advance religion serves to protect the religious freedom of all   of us, and particularly of religious minorities. This point is often not fully   understood by religious believers, who may see such restrictions as   demonstrating hostility to religion. It is not a matter of hostility toward   religion, but rather a structural concern for religious freedom that prohibits   the government from using its power to advance religion. The Supreme Court has   interpreted the Establishment Clause broadly and has invalidated laws that have   either the purpose or effect of advancing religion. The Free Exercise Clause has   been less important in protecting religious freedom, because the Supreme Court?   has not interpreted it expansively. The Court has held that as a general   proposition,? the Free Exercise Clause does not require that the government   exempt religiously motivated conduct from neutral and generally applicable   criminal laws, so that, for example, it is constitutional for the government to   prohibit the use of peyote in the religious services of the Native American   Church.</p>
  <p>However, because religious freedom is a favored value in the American   constitutional system, the Constitution permits the government to undertake   affirmative efforts that are precisely tailored to protect the religious freedom   of individuals and religious institutions. It does not matter that the failure   of the government to take such action would not violate the Free Exercise   Clause. So long as the action is directed toward obviating an interference with   religious freedom that the government itself has imposed, it may be   constitutionally permissible and does not amount to a preference for religion.   Thus, Congress has exempted the use of peyote in the religious services of the   Native-American Church from federal substance abuse laws and has allowed Kosher   and Halal animal slaughter that would otherwise be prohibited by the federal   Humane Slaughter law. Title VII&rsquo;s prohibition against religious discrimination   in employment requires an employer to make a &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; for an   employee&rsquo;s religious beliefs, so long as this can be done without undue hardship   on the conduct of the employer&rsquo;s business. States must, as a condition of   receiving federal funds, make a &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; for the religious   practices of prison inmates. There are man other examples of constitutionally   permissible action designed to protect the religious freedom of individuals and   religious institutions.</p>
  <p>Many years ago, Supreme Court Justice William Douglas stated that, &ldquo;We are a   religious people whose institutions suppose the existence of a Supreme Being.&rdquo;   By every measure, such as church membership, contributions to religious   organizations, religious-based positions on public issues Americans appear to be   more religious than their counterparts in other western democracies such as   Canada, Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. It is also   fair to say that while these countries provide some degree of constitutional or   legal protection to religious freedom, this protection does not approach the   extensive constitutional protection to religious freedom provided in the United   States.</p>
  <p>Professor Sedler maintains that constitutional doctrine can influence values   held by the society at large. Recognizing that there are many explanations for   the greater &ldquo;religiosity&rdquo; of the American people compared with the people in   other western democracies, Professor Sedler proposes that the colloquium explore   the relationship between the greater constitutional protection of religious   freedom in the United States and the greater &ldquo;religiosity&rdquo; of the American   people.</p>

    </strong><strong><em>&ldquo;(Re)vision of a Life: My   Mother's Holocaust Story&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>The Holocaust was a crime of such   proportions and consequences that a focus on individual lives and deaths best   serves to bring us closer to comprehending its scale and scope. Such a focus   also ensures the preservation of both individual recollections and collective   memory for future generations and serves to counteract Holocaust denial.   Authentic oral and written survivor accounts continue to emerge, and it is vital   that they do so because the opportunities for testimony will soon be gone.   Moreover, these individual testimonies honor the memory of the victims and pay   tribute to the survivors, covering the spectrum from deepest despair to greatest   dignity, courage, and hope of heart, mind, and spirit.</p>
  <p>I am the only child of German Jewish Holocaust survivors. My father, Herbert   Abt (1906-1967), and my mother, Goldie Seidner Abt (1911-2004), taught me about   the Holocaust while I was growing up. My mother was consumed all her life by her   experiences in the city (Hamburg) and country of her birth, her forced exile,   and her profound losses. With her advancing age, she felt an urgent need to   discharge a heavy burden. She shared her experiences with me in ever more   specific detail, cognizant of the need to leave them for posterity and   collective memory.</p>
  <p>My memoir of my mother&rsquo;s Holocaust experiences and exile will contribute to   the literary tradition, &ldquo;from mother to daughter,&rdquo; that has found a special   place in Holocaust testimony literature, or literary memoir--or the &ldquo;hybrid of   history with memoir&rdquo; called &ldquo;storia.&rdquo; Everything in my personal and professional   life has led to this memoir project. This presentation, part of a work--and a   journey--in progress, is dedicated to my parents and to my husband, Marvin S.   Schindler, all of blessed memory. And it is written for the third   generation--for my son, Neal Elliott Schindler.</p>

    &ldquo;Age of Aesthetics&rdquo;<br />
  </em></strong>How has life in online   virtual worlds changed in the past decade? MMOs (massively multiplayer online   games or worlds) today are far richer, and far more populous, than text-based   virtual worlds (MUDs and MOOs) were in the early-to-mid 1990s. MMOs have also   become far more attached to &ldquo;everyday life&rdquo; than was ever the case with their   lo-fi predecessors. The utopian, or at least heterotopian, illusions that   suffused life on the &ldquo;virtual frontier&rdquo; back then have given way to a much   fuller integration both into phenomenal experience and into the global circuits   of capital. In this paper, I try to think about these changes by considering   both my own experiences in the virtual worlds LambdaMOO and Second Life, and   Julian Dibbell&rsquo;s two texts about virtual life: My Tiny Life (1999, about   LambdaMOO) and Play Money (2006, about Ultima Online). </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Victorian Women and   Music&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>This paper examines the increasingly active and varied   roles played by middle-class women in the musical revolution that swept through   England during the second half of the nineteenth century, and relates them to   the parallel movement for the emancipation of women. <br />
    <br />
    Although the   feminist movement never took up the 'woman in music' question as a specific   cause, its challenges to perceptions of women's abilities and &quot;proper sphere&quot;   contributed to women violinists, oboists, and composers arriving side by side   with women physicians, university graduates, and scientists. <br />
    <br />
    An   exploration of such topics as domestic music, music education, the instrumental   music profession, and musical composition reveals conflicting images and   realities. While women played increasingly significant roles in England's   amateur and professional musical life by 1914, these roles remained severely   restricted. Music's highest realms, indeed virtually the whole musical   establishment, remained in the control of men--professors, performers,   conductors, composers, producers, agents, impressarios, publishers, and critics.   Only certain aspects of musical activity were considered appropriate for women   and compatible with socialization for femininity, while much of what women did   musically, as in other spheres, continued to be viewed as trivial and unworthy   of serious consideration. <br />
    <br />
    Ultimately the debate on women's musical   abilities and proper place in the late-Victorian world of music reflected the   tensions evoked by the many challenges to traditional roles and stereotypes that   were occurring at the time. The debate was certainly far from settled when the   Great War began. The classical music profession's continuing patriarchy   testifies to this remaining the case. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Is Racial Solidarity Possible   Among African-Americans and Caribbean Blacks?&rdquo;</em></strong><em><br />
    </em>This   paper attempts to contribute to the emerging scholarship that focuses on the   relative saliency of a &ldquo;shared racial group identity&rdquo; between American born   blacks and black immigrants from the Caribbean. More pointedly, we study the   idea of a &ldquo;master status&rdquo; dominating other &ldquo;status identities&rdquo; among American   blacks. We accomplish this by engaging in two interrelated tasks. First, we   construct a schematic, structural equation, model of black group identification   and test it on both an African American and an Afro-Caribbean sample from the   National American Life Survey, 2003. This allows us to examine whether &ldquo;racial   identity&rdquo; overwhelms &ldquo;ethnic identity&rdquo; or whether different historical and   cultural experiences change the saliency of the racial identity among members of   the two groups. We argue that the racialized nature of American society leads to   a common racial identity model for both groups. Yet, we show that the   complexities of the racial and ethnic identities manifest themselves differently   in the structural relationships (causal effects) within the model. We contend   that the different economic, cultural, political and social experiences of the   African and Afro-Caribbean Americans, as measured through our proposed   constructs, feed differently into the &ldquo;common&rdquo; racial script of the two groups.   Second, we take our own argument of a racialized American society to task. We   investigate the systemic nature of racialization by testing how black ethnics   become racialized as African Americans .We retest our proposed model on a   generationally split Afro-Caribbean sample and show evidence of what Clair Kim   (2000) calls &ldquo;minorization of immigrants.&rdquo; </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Edwin Montefiore Borchard (1884 - 1951): Seeking Justice for the   Wrongly Convicted at Yale&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>Edwin Borchard's popular book of   vignettes, Convicting the Innocent (1932), is widely cited in contemporary law   review articles as the earliest significant American work on the wrongful   conviction of factually innocent persons. On the surface, it seems odd that a   leading national expert in international law would delve into the functioning of   police, prosecutors, and criminal courts.<br />
    <br />
    Why did Borchard, a Yale Law   School professor, undertake the project that led to Convicting the Innocent? In   fact, indemnity for the wrongly convicted was a longstanding interest of his.   Other factors also stimulated the project, including the urging of his friend,   Felix Frankfurter, Borchard's progressive attitudes, and the influence of the   legal realist movement at Yale.<br />
    <br />
    The references to Convicting the Innocent   in the law journals rarely allude to the author's efforts in the years following   its publication. Borchard used his considerable energy, contacts, and influence   to conceive of, and successfully lobby for passage of federal legislation to   compensate wrongly convicted persons. The failure to stimulate comparable state   legislation, however, was indicative of the lack of public concern about   convicting the innocent in the years before DNA exonerations became   common.<strong><em><br />

    <em>&ldquo;Admiring the Enemy? French Artists and the North   African (Anti) Hero. 1830-1850&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>After France invaded Algiers in   1830, French artists rushed to visit the Maghreb for the first time in history.   Spurred on by the French public&rsquo;s thirst for information and by the government&rsquo;s   demand for official paintings, artists produced hundreds of images depicting   Algerians. Despite the predominance of negative representations of North   Africans, significant exceptions portrayed them in positive terms as brave and   honorable. I will focus on the challenges posed by a series of unusual portraits   to our current understanding of imagery produced in an era of colonization. <br />
    Four individuals received particularly idealizing treatment at the hands of   French artists: Ali ben Hamet (khalifa of Constantine), Yussuf (colonel and   eventually general of the spahis), Mohammed ben Abou ben Abd el-Malek (commander   of the Moroccan Royal Cavalry), and Abd el-Kader (leader of the Algerian   resistance). Given the context of war and colonization, how can such admiration   be interpreted? Post-colonial theory ? and the studies it has inspired ? argues   that the colonizer&rsquo;s representations of the colonized always reveal a will to   domination. A less totalizing approach, I argue, will enhance our understanding   of the images of the four men in question here. Linked by admiration, the   representations of these men embody different responses from the artists,   ranging from the triumphalist to the subversive. By examining the ways in which   these men were idealized and the artists&rsquo; motivations for doing so, we can   better understand the relationship between imperialism and   image-making.<br />

    <em>&ldquo;Unclenching the Fist: Regarding   Rhetoric's Embodiment</em></strong><em>&rdquo;<br />
      </em>In February 2004, in response   to the shooting deaths of two Detroit police officers, two men from Redford   poured white paint over Monument to Joe Louis. At their arraignment one of the   men explained the vandalism by saying they had wanted to &ldquo;unclench the   fist.&rdquo;<br />
    The claim to want to unclench the fist may sound like a desperate   attempt to justify an indefensible act. It may well be that. But it is also an   expression that raises questions about the distribution of rhetorical agency   among people and objects. As iconoclastic gesture, vandalism of The Fist aimed   to diminish the representational force of the monument. Instead the vandalism   raised questions about whether the monument represents Black Power and where   that representation resides. Does it reside in The Fist itself? Or is it a   representation that resides in the people who view it? These questions are   important for rhetorical studies because they introduce concerns about the   meaningfulness of objects and the potential in those objects to enable and   constrain our expression. Using vandalism of The Fist as my point of reference I   argue for understanding expression as an embodied encounter with   objects.<em><br />

An analysis of   these newsletters is used to explore the symbolical expressions of liberation   that were employed by the League as strategies of resistance and mobilization.   While the newsletters serve some traditional roles within the context of a   social movement--as an agent of recruitment and a method of communication--they   also appear to take the readers on a journey. This journey moves readers from   the negative images of slavery through positive cultural symbols such as   language and aesthetics to a liberated state when they are able to define their   own actions as liberating and empowering. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;The Classical Education of William Pickens:   NAACP Field Director&rdquo;</em></strong><em><br />
    </em>This is a preliminary   examination of the classical influences upon the life of William Pickens   (1881-1954). No secondary scholarship on this topic is available and no   full-scale biography has yet been attempted. The fine analysis by Sheldon Avery   in Up From Washington: William Pickens and the Negro Struggle for Equality,   1900-1954 (1989) which highlights Pickens' years of inspired service to the   NAACP from 1910 to 1942 is the work with which his name is yet associated today.   Nevertheless we need to understand Pickens' childhood and his study of classical   languages at Talladega College and at Yale University if we are to fully grasp   his motivations and his later achievement.</p> 
  <p>Pickens' life began in straightened circumstances. Hardship followed him and   his family for many years. But from his earliest days he was fueled with a   passion for learning and took every opportunity he had to study. Amid these   tough times the young classicist comforted himself with &quot;Vergil's line that   'perchance some day it will be pleasant to remember even these things&quot; [forsan   et haec olim meminisse iuvabit, Aeneid 1. 203] and was moved by his meeting at   Oberlin College in 1900 with William Sanders Scarborough (1852-1926), our   nation's first professional classicist of African descent. Using Pickens   autobiographical writings, Bursting Bonds and The Heir of Slaves and other   sources, this paper will examine the influences that fueled his passion for   education, his study of the classics and the years spent in the early days of   his career as a professor of Latin, Greek and sociology and the first black dean   at Morgan State University.<br />

Molly evolved through the   following political stages: student New Leftist (at Wayne State University in   1968), socialist feminist, Maoist-communist for seven years, and for the past 30   years, a seamstress and militant union organizer with UNITE HERE in Southern   textile factories. </p>
  <p>Molly is en exemplar of a largely unrecognized group: white, working-class,   sixties New Left women who have participated in disproportionately middle-class   social movements. Molly's journey demonstrates how the power of class oppression   and gender hegemony in American society and paradoxically even in the supposed   egalitarian New Left made an indefatigable leftist fall into two traps: feeling   intellectually inferior to her middle-class, college-educated peers, and   internalizing traditional sexist gender roles.</p>

It is argued   here that existing theoretical approaches to guns and crime can be integrated   with opportunity theories to provide a richer understanding of the dynamic   between guns and crime. Data for this analysis are drawn from a sample of 45,913   individuals nested in 39 cities in developing nations. The results of the   hierarchical linear models tested here indicate that city levels of gun   availability influence individual odds of gun crime victimization but not   individual odds of overall crime victimization. These results suggest that gun   availability is not necessarily a cause of crime.

      </em>While historically, hip-hop's   socio-political significance is undeniable, the genre is often relegated to   &quot;booty music&quot;, which dilutes the organic messages that have challenged the   status quo and served as a part of hip-hop's history since its inception in the   late 1960s/early 1970s. Today, rap music leads as the primary defining element   of hip-hop culture and drives its marketability. This marketability is seen   through music videos, partnerships between corporate entities and hip-hop   artists like Nelly and Snoop Dog, and sales of hip-hop music and fashion across   cultural and geographic boundaries. This begs the question &ldquo;Is hip-hop&rsquo;s   commodification a sign of the continued selling and &lsquo;pimping&rsquo; of Black culture   to the masses?&rdquo;, or, as hip-hop critic Greg Tate writes, is it &ldquo;an African   American response to the consumerization and disposability of people&rdquo; (Tate,   1999, p. 386).<br />
    <br />
    Hip-hop culture has been described as the most explosive,   engaging, and controversial form of (black) American pop culture to find global   circulation and acclaim in the last quarter century (Dyson, 2004) and arguably   so. Deemed as a passing fad, the music of hip-hop has permeated not just   American culture, but has touched the lives of individuals all over the world.   But are the images and messages projected through this genre hegemonic and   ultimately self-destructive to the African American community?<br />
    During this   talk, I will argue that the hip-hop phenomenon in American culture, specifically   the music that delivers its message, is worthy of a more critical examination.   It is important to explore the key messages and images that are shared and   understood by members of the hip-hop culture and the implications these messages   and images have on the formation and maintenance of cultural identity. <br />
    <br />
    Hip-Hop music is no longer limited to the ghetto poor, but its major   themes and styles continue to be drawn from the conflicts and contradictions of   black urban life. Through an analysis of music videos, we will explore these   conflicts and contradictions in hip-hop&rsquo;s key messages and discuss major images,   particularly of African American women that are represented in music videos and   artists lyrics.</p>
