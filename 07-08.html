    <em>&ldquo;World Trade Center and United 93 - Traumatic Historical   Film?&rdquo;</em> <br />
    </strong>Simultaneously disruptive and conservative, the   narratives of United 93 and World Trade Center occupy an odd netherworld of   historical representation -- challenging in terms of subject matter, but   narrowly circumscribed in their approach. Shaped by the cultural barriers that   have been erected around the memory of 9/11, both films are scrupulous in their   pursuit of authenticity, and yet focus on such a narrow slice of history that   they seem to deflect historical understanding as well as any larger sense of   &ldquo;coming to terms.&rdquo; While not rising to the level of prohibition that surrounded   Holocaust representation before Schindler&rsquo;s List, the idea that it is still &ldquo;too   soon&rdquo; to represent 9/11 has permeated much of U.S. culture, a perception that   apparently influenced the filmmakers to rigorously delimit their works. As the   critic and essayist Frank Rich has commented, however, perhaps it is already   &ldquo;too late;&rdquo; the event has begun to fade from memory, the culturally therapeutic   value of representing the event may no longer   hold.<strong>*</strong><br />

    <em>&ldquo;Protest and the Public Sphere in   Mexico&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>In Mexico, political liberalization has created the   opportunity for new types of political expression that 70 years of single-party   rule did not accommodate. The various political forces of the nation are   presently working to define a tradition of protected public debate. The present   research investigates contemporary public sphere debate around issues including   electoral accountability, national economic policy, the rights of indigenous   minorities and the role of independent media sources. How do citizens occupy the   public sphere in a democratic Mexico?</p>
  <p>From June 2006 to the present, the state of Oaxaca has been embroiled in   protests demanding the resignation of the governor after his violent crackdown   against teachers protesting for higher wages. The state of Oaxaca is now   militarized, virtually under siege. After the July 2006 presidential election,   over one million supporters of the PRD, whose candidate lost the race by a   razor-thin margin, took to the streets alleging fraud. Tens of thousands shut   down the most prominent boulevard in Mexico City for 45 days, demanding a full   recount. In January 2007, 70,000 citizens marched to demand government control   of the spiralling cost of tortillas, and gained a temporary price cap. In the   southern state of Chiapas, citizens continue a decades-long experiment in   automonous participatory democracy.</p>
  <p>Our research, still at an early stage, finds that citizen action in the   public sphere in some cases makes important contributions to the nation&rsquo;s   political discourse. In other cases, political participation in the public   sphere is perceived to impede political progress by reinforcing non-democratic   patterns of the past. </p>
  <p>Dr. Lean will be accompanied in this presentation by five students who   conducted research in Mexico in August 2007 with the support of a WSU Global   Grant. During the colloquium, they will each speak briefly about their   findings.</p>

      <em>&ldquo;Ideologies of Language in Catalonia&rdquo;</em><br />
    </strong>The   re-institutionalization of Catalan following the passage of the 1979 Catalan   Statute of Autonomy has put the language on display in the public sphere.   Because Catalan acts as a sign of a Catalan nation, representations of Catalan   are fraught, and linguistic regimentation is prevalent. This project examines   sites for the display and regimentation of Catalan (such as television   broadcasting and language planning). My work reveals, on the one hand, an   increasing definition of Catalan as a public language and, on the other hand,   the notion that the language has not attained full public status. According to   this language ideology, Catalan is a monologic language that operates   exclusively as a codified, normative standard and not as a language composed of   multiple registers capable of indexing all social positions. Catalan&rsquo;s purported   lack of registers is part of a language ideology that compares Catalan   unfavorably to hegemonic national languages. According to this view, Catalan is   not &ldquo;normal&rdquo; because it has failed to become the taken-for-granted language   associated with a discrete political territory. </p>

      &ldquo;300 and the Ancient and Modern Idealization of the   Spartans&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>The film 300, which follows the exploits of King   Leonidas and his men at Thermopylae in 480 B.C., exalts the Spartans as warriors   who unstintingly adhere to the tenets of honor, duty, and glory, and who refuse   to retreat under any circumstances. I propose to examine the historicity of this   portrayal and to suggest that it forms part of a long, and often misguided   tradition of idealizing ancient Sparta. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Sex and Syntax: Explaining Human Grammars through   Evolutionary Forces&rdquo;</em><br />
  </strong>Highlighting the challenge for an   evolutionary approach to syntax/grammar, and ridiculing some attempts at it, one   of Chomsky&rsquo;s followers, Lightfoot, says regarding one abstract syntactic   principle: &ldquo;Subjacency has many virtues, but ? it could not have increased the   chances of having fruitful sex.&rdquo; Nonetheless, in my project I argue that there   are certain marginal constructions in modern-day languages that are best   analyzed as evolutionary &lsquo;fossils&rsquo; of a simpler stage of syntax. In English,   these include mini sentences (e.g. Problem solved; Family first!; Him worry?!)   and certain &lsquo;exocentric&rsquo; compounds (e.g. pick-pocket, turn-coat, Mar-wood,   dare-devil). Exocentric compounds, which across languages evoke striking images,   often derogatory and vulgar, can give a glimpse into the very beginnings of   syntax, as well as into how sexual selection might have helped shape syntax.   Seen in this completely novel light, both sentence formation (subsuming   principles such as Subjacency) and compound formation benefit from being   subjected to evolutionary explanations.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;Shot in   Silence: Labor Photography and Commentary in Black and Red,   1932-34&rdquo;</em><br />
  </strong>A paper and presentation on the photo albums (some of   which carry commentary) of Walter and Victor Reuther. These books, one of which   was a project for a course at Wayne, were made at virtually the same time as the   Ford Hunger March and initial union and unemployed organizing efforts in   Detroit; while silent about these events, these amateur photographers and future   labor professionals shot films of Detroit's Black Bottom and the Gorky Ford   Motor Plant in USSR that cry out to be brought into interdisciplinary   discussions that can take them diacritically outside the normative   interrogations of labor history and aesthetics. Official labor history,   including that of the UAW, has been virtually silent about the Soviet and   domestic, youthful political affiliations and artistic adventures of these labor   leaders; not for this reason alone, the interest that this research can now   excite cannot be over-estimated. Part of what is new and different is that the   work of these young activists, barely in their 20s in the 30s, is that 'the work   of art [and activism] in the age of digital reproduction' allows one to see so   much more of the eyes and &quot;I's&quot; behind the camera than ever before.</p>

    </em></strong>A study of parental involvement in   schooling (among recent Mexican immigrants who spoke only Spanish and whose   children attended predominantly Black urban public schools) raised important   questions about preserving the full range of parents&rsquo; verbal expression in   research findings. We continuously asked ourselves: How can we better represent   the voices of research participants? Customary ways of reporting findings seemed   lifeless and cold compared to the animated, emotional conversations occurring   during interviews. We argue that poetics, which share some of the qualities of   poems, have potential to fill this gap. </p>
  <p>Poetry holds a special place among literary forms. As Percy Bysshe Shelley   once wrote: &ldquo;Reason is the enumeration of qualities already known; imagination   is the perception of the value of those qualities, both separately and as a   whole? Poetry, in a general sense, may be defined to be &lsquo;the expression of the   imagination?.&rsquo;&rdquo; As we use the term, poetics meld reason and imagination. They   are products of qualitative data analysis, so on the one hand relate to what we   know (are related to reason). But, on the other hand, poetics tap the   recollections and mental images through which research participants made sense   of their world, so relate to the imagination. Join us, then, for a brief   overview about constructing poetics, followed by poetics from the heart ? a   &ldquo;poetry&rdquo; reading in Spanish and English ? as we present selected findings from   this research study.<br />

    <em>&ldquo;Bearding Brutus: Paradigmatic Pressure and the Rise and Fall of   the Roman Republic&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>By studying elements of stagecraft (i.e.,   entrances, exits, gestures, etc.) in the 1st century Roman dramas of Seneca much   can be learned which can aid in the interpretation of these plays. For example,   Seneca appears to follow the rule of three actors which he seems to have   inherited from Greek tragedy; except for two places, the plays can be performed   with no more than three speaking actors on-stage at any given time, provided   that those actors can exit, change masks, and return as different characters.   One notices that the roles are distributed among the available actors in   significant ways: in several plays, all of the male roles belong to the same   actor. Often relatives (father and son, cousins, husband and wife) are given to   the same actor, as are murderers and victims. And in one play, the Hercules   Furens, the three roles played by one actor, while very different characters,   all perform the same functions of observer and persecutor of the protagonist. </p>

    </strong>In 1851, the brothers Jules and Edmond de Goncourt   began to record their impressions of contemporary life, art and mores in Paris,   collected eventually as the Journal. M?moires de la vie litt?raire. Their   inspiration for undertaking this journal was the aphoristic writings of the   seventeenth- and eighteenth-century moralistes, and to these learned models of   French high culture, the brothers Goncourt added elements of an equally lofty   artistic sensibility nourished by their evolving activities as collectors and   connoisseurs of the plastic arts. However, in contrast to the cultural heights   to which they aspired, they also cultivated what would become a hyper-realist,   even naturalist, commitment to a literary practice based on the stark depiction   of truth. They translated this commitment into the unbridled examination and   critique of their contemporaries, starting from their observation of the   Parisian demi-monde, through the literary and intellectual milieu, to the   heights of Second Empire society. This contrast between heights and depths   reveals at once the difficulties they encountered as aspiring hommes de lettres   in the Parisian literary battleground and the fascination they exhibited with   myriad contemporary erotic practices, their own as well as those they observed.   In the brown-bag lecture, I propose to outline at once the obstacles that the   brothers faced in moving, despite themselves, toward an iconoclastic and   paradoxical membership in the empire of letters under Napol?on III and their   collaborative approach to this ascent precisely through a persistent, indeed   obsessive examination of the erotics of their contemporary   culture.<strong><br />

      <em>&ldquo;Reinventing Opera: The Role of Dance and   Choreography in Contemporary Opera Productions&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>For nearly 300   years, opera has been considered to be the highest of all performing art forms   with its emphasis on combining all the arts in grand spectacle. Until recently   has dance and choreography become more critical to opera, particularly in   contemporary productions during the late 20th century into the early millennium   including Emmanuel Chabrier&rsquo;s opera buffe L&rsquo;Etoile, among others.</p>
  <p>Critically analyzing the collaborative and artistic processes within the   genre of contemporary choreography for opera productions reveal   reinterpretations of the classic opera in form, structure, design and   performance.</p>
  <p>Artistic directors of opera companies together with stage directors across   the nation and abroad are seeking the expertise of contemporary modern   choreographers to be part of the main creative ensemble. During the last three   decades, choreographers such as Trisha Brown, Lucinda Child, Se?n Curran, Mark   Dendy, Bill T. Jones, and Doug Varone, and Mark Morris have become collaborators   in major opera productions and have significantly contributed to the innovative   visual aesthetics within contemporary opera.</p>
  <p>Movement and dance for opera have become more complex for the opera performer   as the role of choreography and the significance of the choreographer have   become increasingly central to the shifting visual landscape of opera   productions. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;The   Stagecraft of Seneca&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>By studying elements of stagecraft (i.e.,   entrances, exits, gestures, etc.) in the 1st century Roman dramas of Seneca much   can be learned which can aid in the interpretation of these plays. For example,   Seneca appears to follow the rule of three actors which he seems to have   inherited from Greek tragedy; except for two places, the plays can be performed   with no more than three speaking actors on-stage at any given time, provided   that those actors can exit, change masks, and return as different characters.   One notices that the roles are distributed among the available actors in   significant ways: in several plays, all of the male roles belong to the same   actor. Often relatives (father and son, cousins, husband and wife) are given to   the same actor, as are murderers and victims. And in one play, the Hercules   Furens, the three roles played by one actor, while very different characters,   all perform the same functions of observer and persecutor of the protagonist. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Parenting and Parallel Socialization among Immigrant   Children&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>Raising children in a multicultural society and   parenting them in an alien culture without a reference group can be a daunting   challenge. The generation gap becomes more evident for immigrant families than   for their non-immigrant counterparts. Parents desire to be role models for their   children but there are limits to their ability to play this role: There are   certain factors in American society which both immigrant parents and children   are exposed to at the same time, often resulting in children quickly outsmarting   their parents.<br />
    <br />
    The children&rsquo;s world, however, is split between home and   school because of two different sets of norms, expectations and role models thus   leading to <em>parallel socialization.</em> <br />
    <br />
    Popular culture is at times   another important challenge, more often for its negative influences than   positive. The picking and choosing these families go through in terms of   cultural dualities and the lack of suitable role models is very confusing. A   loud and clear mediation is required by the parents to help their children   process popular culture in compatibility with their own culture. In such   situations, parents play the multiple roles of the extended family in balancing   out the challenges of parallel socialization and acculturation. While they have   to substitute for the missing extended family, they also need to work with   teachers at school as copartners in a joint mentoring process for their kids.   These two components add to parenting and make it a challenging   ordeal.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>

    <em>&ldquo;Translations before the   Translation&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>In contemporary literary criticism the notion of   multiple readings is quite familiar. However, translation studies has not yet   fully taken account of this concept. Instead, translators--as well as theorists   of translation--generally assume a one-to-one relationship to the text, in which   it is the translator&rsquo;s interaction with the text that determines its meaning,   with little to no attention given to the original readers&rsquo; interpretations. In   this presentation we will discuss the misapprehensions that may arise when a   work that is read in multiple ways is translated without acknowledging this   variety of interpretations. Our case study will be The Wolf Totem [Lang tuteng],   a work that was a best-seller in China and whose publication in English has been   timed to coincide with the Olympics in Beijing. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Coming to Terms with Ruthlessness:   Sovereign Equality and the Limits of </em></strong>International Criminal   Justice&rdquo; <br />
    International efforts to secure the bases of human well-being   routinely require the cooperation of political leaders to whom significant human   rights violations can be attributed. Working relationships in the international   arena largely depend on maintaining an &ldquo;agreement to disagree,&rdquo; not only about   conflicts of interest, but also about matters of fundamental justice. </p>
  <p>International law needs to maintain a balance between ideological pluralism   and insistence on the inadmissibility of practices reprehended by an overlapping   consensus of disparate belief systems. International penal processes, such as   those established by the International Criminal Tribunals for the former   Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the new International Criminal Court, are generally   appropriate to the latter function. </p>
  <p>However, when domestic courts seek to vindicate universal principles   unilaterally by asserting extraterritorial penal jurisdiction over acts of   foreign states in the name of international law, the result may be to jeopardize   the international legal order&rsquo;s indispensable function of facilitating   accommodation. Legal doctrines limiting extraterritorial prosecution ? such as   jurisdictional limitations, personal and functional immunities of foreign state   officials, and strict interpretations of the principle of nullum crimen sine   lege ? though obstructive of the pursuit of substantive justice, constitute   important safeguards against threats to the normative platform that undergirds   peaceful and respectful international relations. <strong><em></em></strong></p>

      &ldquo;The Works Progress Administration Manuscript Collection in the Detroit   Symphony Orchestra Music Library&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>During President Franklin D.   Roosevelt&rsquo;s presidency, attempts to ease the vast unemployment of the Depression   resulted in several unique and historically significant music projects. From   1935 -1943, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) provided employment for   hundreds of musicians under the Federal Music Project, a section of Federal   Project One. Along with establishing orchestras and bands across the nation, the   Federal Music Project also gave employment to music copyists. The Music Copying   Project provided conductors with scores and instrumental parts for the   performing groups. The music was all copied by hand and signed by the copyist.   Since most copyists were not musicians but professional draftspersons who were   trained to copy music, each page was carefully checked for errors before it was   declared satisfactory work. </p>
  <p>In 1939 the federal government gave control of the WPA operations to the   states. At that time, the Federal Music Project became a state-run Music   Project. Nearly every state had a WPA Music-Copying Project that continued until   1943 when the federal government dismantled the WPA completely. Representative   of the state Music Copying Projects, the Michigan Music Copying Project provided   scores and parts for the Michigan WPA orchestras. The music was held in a   central WPA music library in Lansing, MI. When the WPA orchestras and library   were disbanded in 1943, the music was sent to the Detroit Symphony Orchestra   (DSO), the oldest and largest continuing orchestra in the state. The DSO   performed selections from this Collection regularly over the next 40 years. At   some point during the 1980s, the collection was boxed and stored in a basement   room under the main stage of Orchestra Hall, the performing home of the DSO, and   not discovered there until 2005. </p>
  <p>This music was intended for performance. The value of this collection is the   fact that most of the music is still in playable condition, but needs   conservation to keep it that way. This presentation will focus on the history of   this collection, with a description of the catalog, and the proposal for   conserving it for future performance, and making it accessible to researchers   and the general public.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;What is &lsquo;Successful Aging&rsquo; in Michigan   Communities?&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>Successful aging literature suggests that older   adults have agency and autonomy over disease and disability. To remaining free   from disability and disease, older adults maintain a high level of physical and   cognitive functioning, continue interpersonal relationships, and contribute   productively to society. Much of this literature on successful aging has been   quantitative and somewhat prescriptive, defining &ldquo;aging&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;success&rdquo; in   aging very narrowly; thus, this presentation serves to critique this literature   by reporting on a 2006 survey of Michigan residents about their &ldquo;success&rdquo; in   aging. Specifically, survey data is presented to show whether and how diverse   individuals define themselves as successful agers. In her conclusions, the   author calls for a broader conceptualization of what it means to age   &ldquo;successfully&rdquo; and additional sociological research in this area, to promote a   greater understanding of how diverse populations conceptualize and engage in   aging processes. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;The Shaping Up Years:   Labor Reporting, Working-Class Culture Politics, and Labor Movement Survival   after World War I&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>This paper concerns the revival of labor   journalism in the years after World War I and the working-class and left   intellectuals who kept the knowledge of labor organizing alive in the decade   between 1919 and 1929. By 1922, wartime measures in the United States had   devastated the vibrant radical journalism of the pre-war era. Thousands of   dailies, weeklies, and monthlies closed under postal censorship and wartime   inflation; reporters and editors came under the scrutiny of the Espionage and   Sedition Acts, and foreign-language publications faced political reaction during   and after World War I. What was required, as labor organizers and radical   activists realized during the postwar strike wave, was labor journalism that   could fly under political radar and at the same time provide an alternative and   credible source of information and education for workers and the public at   large. The Federated Press, a labor news service, seemed to answer the bill, as   it created a new network of labor, farm, and radical publications that gathered   and disseminated the news of political and labor organization and provided   critical analysis of the issues of the day. What was perhaps more important was   that the Federated Press also constituted a network of individuals who created   new forms of social knowledge, gathered information from workers across the   country and abroad, and educated workers and policy-makers about the condition,   political allegiance, and character of the working   class.<strong><em><br />

    <em>&ldquo;The   Spanish Galateo: When Jokes and Laughter Become a Serious   Matter&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    The publication in 1593 of Lucas Graci?n Dantisco&rsquo;s El   Galateo espa?ol, a free adaptation of Giovanni della Casa&rsquo;s Galateo, would be an   innovative force on Spanish conceptions of &lsquo;decorum&rsquo; and propriety. While   Dantisco&rsquo;s is only the second translation into Spanish of the Italian treatise,   it was widely read, and influential to writers such as Cervantes or Graci?n. <br />
    El Galateo espa?ol is important because of its focus on the concrete aspects   of courtesy, which signals a shift toward a practical tone in the discourses on   social discipline. This presentation will examine the role structurally played   by jokes and laughter, as introduced by the avowedly male narratorial voice, in   this change. As part of its more practical approach to manners and courtesy,   Galateo develops a narrative in which jokes and &lsquo;burlas&rsquo; (pranks) become a   pedagogical tool for its intended male reader: as a cautionary tale, examples of   exchanges gone awry readily illustrate the dangers of inadequate conduct in the   form of social embarrassment or social shame. Simultaneously, in its focus on   the process of courtesy, Dantisco&rsquo;s work displays an urbane rather than a   courtly humor. Finally, it also attests to the increasing interest in jokes and   &lsquo;burlas,&rsquo; both as social ornamenta and as potential pitfalls of the successful   social exchange.<br />

  <p>Brian Friel sets his play in 1833 inside an Irish Hedge School in County   Donegal. The new English Language National Schools are replacing the Gaelic   language local schools. With this as a backdrop, the inciting incident in the   play comes with the arrival of the British Army to carry out the first Ordnance   Survey in which all Irish name places will be changed to English name places. </p>
  <p>Last semester Chris Collins (Music) and Steven Stone (Dance) worked with   Lavinia Hart (Theatre) on scoring original music and dance/movement to the text   of Brian Friel&rsquo;s play Translations. The collaboration included the component of   sign language interpretation by Dan McDougall and Shelly Tocco, founding members   of Terp-Theatre Detroit. The purpose of the exploration was to examine the   levels of translation required to realize the phenomenon of genuine   communication between two cultures locked in conflict. The major dramatic   question of the play asks &ldquo;Can a new way of speaking, not related to dominance   and subjugation, exist between the divide, however briefly?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Chris Collins&rsquo; compositions captured both Irish and British traditional   musical styles to reflect the prominent cultures; Steven Stone staged key   moments of dance/movement to impart pictorial information to the non-hearing   audience; and the signers represented differences in language through Signed   Exact English for British characters and American Sign Language for Irish   speaking characters. Lavinia Hart directed the project.</p>

      <em>&ldquo;Contemporary Approaches to Neighborhood   Revitalization&rdquo;</em><br />
    </strong>Urban America has long been plagued by the   presence of neighborhoods that house high concentrations of poor people and   provide them with living conditions substantially inferior to the social norms   of the day.</p>
  <p>Referred to over the years as slums, ghettos, blighted neighborhoods, or   simply &quot;the wrong side of the tracks,&quot; such neighborhoods have commonly received   the most active attention when they have been perceived as a drag on local   economic development and prosperity. While systematic local efforts to improve   conditions in poor neighborhoods date back at least to the early 20^th century,   major initiatives with a national profile post-date World War II. In this   seminar, a brief review of the well-known large federal programs (such as the   War on Poverty and the Empowerment Zone programs) will set the stage for an   examination of the more numerous and lower profile attempts by local governments   and nonprofit organizations to improve physical and economic conditions in poor   and at-risk neighborhoods. The discussion will focus both on promising   strategies (e.g., targeted infrastructure investments, housing construction and   rehabilitation, comprehensive neighborhood planning, and greater community voice   in local decision-making in matters of neighborhood concern) and key challenges   to implementing them successfully.<br />

        <em>&ldquo;Intimacies: Sleep, Families, and   Disease&rdquo;</em><br />
      </strong>Over the past decade there has been a dramatic rise in   both the diagnosis of and available treatments for sleep disorders. The makers   of sleep aids (Ambien, Lunesta, Rozerem) have all annually posted hundreds of   millions of dollars in profit over the past five years, due in large part to   this new medical interest in sleep and generated in large part by these new   drugs. When patients seek medical treatment for sleep disorders, what they are   often seeking is a return to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life, a return to daily work schedules and   the easing of social tensions stemming from their disrupted sleep. But in order   to achieve this return to normalcy, they must accept a pharmaceutical fix for   their sleep disorder.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I trace the idea of intimacy as it operates in the   contemporary practice of sleep medicine in the United States. I juxtapose the   sleep disorders of obstructive sleep apnea and REM behavior disorder, their   treatments, and the cultural understandings of patients, clinicians and   researchers in an effort to rethink what it means to be intimate in the   contemporary pharmaceutical age, along with who and what we can be intimate   with, what the foundations of this new intimacy are, and what these intimacies   can generate.<br />

    <em>&ldquo;The   Dying Diva: Violent Ends for Clara Calamai in Visconti&rsquo;s Ossessione and   Argento&rsquo;s Profondo rosso&rdquo; </em><br />
    </strong>At the conclusion of Luchino   Visconti&rsquo;s film Ossessione (1943), the female protagonist, Giovanna, is killed   in a violent auto accident while fleeing the police with her lover. At the end   of Dario Argento&rsquo;s psychological thriller Profondo rosso (1975), piano-playing   detective Marc Daly (played by David Hemmings) manages to save himself by   killing a hatchet-wielding attacker who has slashed her way through much of the   rest of the cast. The fatal neck wounds that end Ossessione and Profondo rosso   are inflicted in both instances on actress Clara Calamai, whose violent death   concludes two films made more than thirty years apart. In each narrative, the   beautiful diva plays the part of both assassin and victim. <br />
    <br />
    These   analogies create physical and historical links between Visconti&rsquo;s and Argento&rsquo;s   films, links that inspire a series of questions about the role of this donna   delinquente and about the relationship between the two films. What messages,   written on Calamai&rsquo;s body and scrawled in her blood, might we read in the final,   hauntingly similar images? In the transition from film to film, the diva&rsquo;s dying   frame becomes a physical palimpsest that reveals, under the layers of her flesh,   traces of what came before, an organic monument to the passage of time. Evident   in these two different cinematic moments are divergent epistemologies of crime,   socio-political attitudes that speak both to the periods in which the films were   produced and to the relationship between two moments in Italian cinema. <strong><br />

        Suzanne Hilgendorf, Assistant Professor, Classical and   Modern Languages, Literatures and Cultures, <em>&ldquo;International Media and the   English Language: The Linguistic Impact of Hollywood in Germany&rdquo; </em><br />
        </strong>In today&rsquo;s era of globalization, the media play a prominent   role in the international spread of English. Among the most influential media   forces is the Hollywood film industry, which has dominated world cinema since   the early 20th century. One country where this powerful presence has been felt   is Germany, where in 2003 U.S. films generated a remarkable 76.8% of total   screen revenues.<br />
    <br />
    Taking the example of Germany, this paper considers the   linguistic impact occurring as a result of the dominant presence of U.S. films.   While voice-over synchronization remains standard treatment for U.S.   productions, English nevertheless has a conspicuous presence within the domain   as it is used extensively in the titling of films for German release. An   analysis of film titles from 1986 to 2005 (ca. 400 films) reveals a continuum of   language use between the two poles of English and German, with films commonly   being released with their original English title or a code-mixed variation.   Attesting to the status of English within the domain is the fact this practice   has spread to German productions as well, as is reflected in the examples of the   successful films Go, Trabi, Go! (1991) and Good Bye, Lenin! (2003). <strong><br />

          </strong>In 1881, American humourist and author Mark Twain paid his   first visit to Canada. Arriving in Montreal during a snowstorm, it wasn&rsquo;t for   his own edification that he undertook this journey. Rather, Twain&rsquo;s visit was   necessitated by his desire to secure a Canadian copyright over his latest book,   The Prince and the Pauper and to free himself, once and for all, of the scourge   of Canadian &lsquo;buccaneers and pirates&rsquo; who were publishing his works in Canada   without his permission. This paper will explore the legal context underlying   copyright in Canada in the middle to late 19th century and the particular set of   circumstances that led Twain to make that fateful journey. It will highlight the   roles that both Britain and the US played in shaping 19th century Canadian   copyright law ? a body of law that so exasperated Twain that he noted: &ldquo;Only one   thing is impossible for God: to find any sense in any copyright law on the   planet.&rdquo;<br />

      </strong>Is it possible to construct a compelling   argument against same-sex marriage without appealing either to religious   conviction or to the claim that such unions are inherently morally wrong? In his   recent book The Future of Marriage, David Blankenhorn attempts to do just that,   arguing that to endorse same-sex marriage is to move society further away from   the idea that children need mothers and fathers, a movement which in turn would   harm all children (and not just the children of same-sex couples). It's an   intriguing argument worthy of serious consideration. In this talk I explore and   evaluate Blankenhorn's argument.<strong><br />

      <em>&ldquo;We have to live upon what we can catch&rsquo;: Mordecai Noah and She   Would Be a Soldier&rdquo;<br />
        </em></strong>Authors in the early republic relied   heavily on forms, genres, diction, tropes, conceptions of beauty, etc. found in   18th century British writers such as Addison, Pope, et al. These writings have   traditionally been condemned as derivative, an aesthetic of the merely   ornamental, explained if not excused insofar as they express a necessary   provincial backwardness. These texts and authors have been dismissed in an   American literary criticism shaped by nationalism and exceptionalism; those that   have continued to matter, Irving and Cooper, for example, have gained inclusion   insofar as their work could be fitted into the national narrative with perhaps   an embarrassed silence about those elements that make too much room for the   aesthetic and especially the ornamental.<br />
    <br />
    The negative judgment of   literary work marked by borrowings, derivativeness and dependence is, however,   not all the case there is. The writers of the early republic might have   responded, in Mordecai Noah&rsquo;s phrase, that they &ldquo;have to live upon what we   catch.&rdquo; If we put aside nationalist and exceptionalist assumptions, the   ornamental can be seen to be both as a legitimate aesthetic and a vehicle to do   cultural work in the new republic. <br />
    In this paper I trace the aesthetic of   the ornamental in Mordecai Noah&rsquo;s She Would Be a Soldier (1819) to argue that,   at least according to the play, the ornamental and the affective relation to it   move individuals and society. This apologia for the ornamental in Noah (and   others) is part of a larger rereading of texts from the early republic, those   which have been unworthy of critical approbation because they are derivative and   thus inauthentic. I hope to expand our sense of what counts as aesthetic, in   part by noting that canonical modes of American literature and literary   criticism have been, at best, suspicious, of any form of the aesthetic and   contemptuous of those that depart from organicism. <strong><em><br />

      <em>&ldquo;Rosa Matilda and &lsquo;Jew&rsquo; King: Poetry, Gothic Novels and Gonefs in   the Romantic Era&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    John or Jonathan King, born Jacob Rey, known   in Georgian London as &ldquo;Jew&rdquo; King (c. 1753-1823), was an extraordinary but   perhaps not unrepresentative figure illustrating the place of Jews in English   society. Moneylender, editor of a radical newspaper, political controversialist,   apologist for Judaism, King also practiced &ldquo;unrespectable&rdquo; radical politics that   used blackmail. His financial dealings were complex, sometimes criminal. He knew   well, or lent money to, or entertained at his famous dinner parties prominent   figures like Mary Robinson, Thomas Paine, William Godwin, Richard Sheridan,   Charles Fox, and Lord Byron, in addition to various aristocrats with a taste for   gambling and prostitutes. Two of his daughters, Sophia and Charlotte, wrote   innovative poetry that influenced Byron and Shelley and that has been newly   appreciated as romantic women&rsquo;s writing illustrating Jerome McGann&rsquo;s concept of   the poetics of sensibility. Sophia and Charlotte also wrote numerous novels,   mostly Gothic fiction, that was as innovative as their poetry. Long considered   just trashy, their fiction, especially Charlotte&rsquo;s Zofloya (1806), has enjoyed   new readings as sexually expressive and philosophically provocative. Long   ignored or dismissed, the King family in its own peculiar way reconfigures our   understanding of both literary romanticism and Georgian Anglo-Jewry. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;A German in the   North American Prairies: Max Sering and the Concept of Inner   Colonization&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>Max Sering is the most direct biographical link   between the western colonial frontier of North America, and the eastern colonial   frontier of Prussian Poland. He personally envisioned Germany&rsquo;s future in the   East while studying &lsquo;inner colonization&rsquo; in Canada and America in the Summer of   1883, and was then key in convincing Bismarck and others to transform Germany&rsquo;s   colonial mission from one of overseas expansion to that of the &lsquo;much more   important&rsquo; inner colonization of Germany&rsquo;s eastern frontier. As the godfather of   inner colonization, Sering was then lionized during the Weimar years, for having   been &lsquo;right&rsquo;. Indeed, his concepts travel directly into the pages of Mein Kampf,   then being dictated at the height of Sering&rsquo;s fame in 1924, &lsquo;It cannot be   emphasized sharply enough that any German internal colonization must serve to   eliminate social abuses particularly to withdraw the soil from widespread   speculation, but can never suffice to secure the future of the nation without   the acquisition of new soil&rsquo;. Indeed, Hitler rejected overseas colonialism for   many of the same reasons as did Sering, yet faulted the goals of internal   colonization for their ultimate timidity. </p>
  <p>In 1883, the German agrarian economist Max Sering was dispatched to North   America to discover why it was that farmers from Germany&rsquo;s East were emigrating   in droves to essentially the same type of land on the far side of the Atlantic.   What he discovered there was a government-sponsored program to pay for and   settle small farmers. It was a &lsquo;colonial&rsquo; program within the mother country&rsquo;s   borders, and it excited him immensely. He returned to Berlin and made a   passionate attempt to convince Bismarck that an &lsquo;inner&rsquo; colonial empire in the   East, where German farmers would send &lsquo;wagons&rsquo; east&rsquo;, settle and displace the   local natives (Prussian Poles), was Germany&rsquo;s future. In this same period,   1883-85, Bismarck largely ended the overseas expansion of the German empire and   set up the Prussian Settlement Commission. Over the next thirty years, while   German settlers moved east, a large literature grew up around the idea of &lsquo;inner   colonization&rsquo;, centering upon the ideas put forward by the Society for Inner   Colonization, an intellectual and political body headed by Sering and Alfred   Hugenberg. When German armies captured huge swaths of land to the East in 1915,   these very same thinkers were called upon to greatly expand their colonial   dreams, now to include the Baltics and Belarus.</p>

    <em>&ldquo;Discipline and Narrative: British Publishers and Historical   Knowledge 1850-1950&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>The history of the book in Britain   includes history books as well as the more famous fictional works that sat   beside them on shelves and parlor tables. Mid-Victorian historians (people like   Macaulay and Froude) wrote strong narratives that were as attractive as novels   to commercial publishers. But their successors in the 1880s and 1890s (J. R.   Seeley, Mandell Creighton and others) wanted to &ldquo;break the drowsy spell of   narrative&rdquo; and make history a science. The textual and material object we know   as &lsquo;the book&rsquo; became a testing ground for academic professionalization, and   publishers developed new formats, such as periodicals, multi-volume series and   collaborative histories, for the dissemination of serious historical   scholarship. Meanwhile, they still courted Charlotte Yonge and other authors of   &ldquo;delightful&rdquo; history books for children and for the common reader. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Colonizing   Palestine: The Politics of Place and Nation Under Israeli Military   Rule&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>The Palestinian-Israeli national conflict, the subject of   intense international interest, has been generally misunderstood as a &ldquo;religious   conflict&rdquo; or an &ldquo;eternal,&rdquo; age-old struggle between cultures and peoples   naturally irreconcilably at odds. This talk not only examines the ahistorical   quality of such claims, but also makes the case for looking at Israeli rule over   the Palestinians as colonial rule. I detail the ways in which this national   conflict is largely one over housing and land and explores the ways in which   Israeli colonial power has functioned spatially in Jerusalem. I examine how   Israeli military forces and other institutions have appropriated particular   Palestinian homes in this divided urban center and remade them in an effort to   project specific nationalist meanings, privilege particular memories of the   city, and assert claims of exclusive ownership and rights to a Jerusalem central   to the national cosmologies of Palestinians, no less than Israelis. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s   The Road, Kierkegaard, and Suspending the Ethical Now&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>My   argument here is straightforward, linear even. The Winter&rsquo;s Tale is a powerfully   religious play about Paul&rsquo;s understanding of grace and messianic time. This   might not sound like a terribly provocative argument for a play that features a   character named &ldquo;Paulina&rdquo; and one named &ldquo;Time&rdquo; and a unique (for Shakespeare)   resurrection, but when it comes to matters of religion Shakespearean scholarship   has a remarkable and willful capacity to ignore the obvious. More precisely, the   play provides a dramatic glimpse of Paul&rsquo;s conception of the way time contracts   or begins to come to end following the messianic moment of &ldquo;grace&rdquo; (charis) but   before the end of time (eschaton). In order to make this claim I rely on a great   deal of late twentieth-century scholarship on Paul but I give particular   attention to Giorgio Agamben&rsquo;s The Time that Remains. I also pay special   attention to Paul&rsquo;s suggestion that married men, in particular, have a difficult   time grasping &ldquo;the time of the now&rdquo; (ho nyn kairos). </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Self Esteem and Body Image&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>This study examined   the effect of a self-esteem threat combined with exposure to thin images on body   image (BI) satisfaction and investment. Female participants (N = 94) received a   self-esteem threat consisting of false failure feedback or received false   success feedback on an intellectual task allegedly highly predictive of academic   and professional success. They then viewed media images featuring thin models or   products. After viewing thin models, women who had received failure feedback   declared themselves more satisfied about their appearance and less invested in   it than did women who had received success feedback. These results suggest that   exposure to the thin ideal may inspire women experiencing self-esteem threats to   use appearance as an alternative source of worth, thus maintaining their global   esteem through BI compensatory self-enhancement. Potential long term   implications of this strategy, such as a paradoxical increase in BI investment   and the development of eating pathology, are discussed. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Western Media and Adolescent   Development in Guyana&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>This study evaluates the relationship of   western television consumption and exposure to the cultural values and   preferences of adolescents in Guyana. Specifically, it compares preferences for   indigenous cultural influences in the light of the diffusion of Western   entertainment media, beginning with the availability of home television in the   early 80&rsquo;s, and the proliferation of other media forms in the 90&rsquo;s. The paper   also assesses adolescents&rsquo; choices of various forms of entertainment, arts,   music, literature, food, folk heroes, sports and sport heroes, and demonstrates   the positive relationship between such preferences and the consumption of   Western television media. Finally, the paper demonstrates that the imbalance   between Western and Caribbean cultural knowledge, and links this to Western   media exposure. The implications of the findings for the study of globalization   are discussed. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Effa   Manley and the Politics of Passing for Black or White&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>In 2006   Effa Manley became the first woman inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame.   Manley's work with the Newark Eagles is well-documented including the signing of   Hall of Famers Larry Doby and Monte Irvin, among others, as well as her fight to   receive compensation from Major League owners for signing Negro League players.   Her civil rights activism is also extraordinary and well-known: she was a member   of the NAACP, held anti-lynching days at the ballpark, and led boycotts of   business that would not hire blacks. <br />
    <br />
    The one aspect of Manley's life   that is less explicit is her racial background. It seems that Manley   successfully straddled the color line by claiming different racial identities   based on the situation and who was asking the questions. This presentation would   examine the issue of passing within professional baseball using Manley as an   example. I will discuss the differing implications of Manley passing for white   or passing for black and in addition, I will also place Manley's racial   identities within the greater context of passing within baseball specifically   and American culture more broadly.<strong><em><br />

    <em>&ldquo;Integrating On-line Learning in Foreign Language   Instruction&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>In this session presenters highlight their use of   online technology in the teaching of foreign language and culture in three   different settings: Multimedia course materials were used in creating a virtual   repository of authentic material in the teaching of contemporary francophone   culture, customized video material matching grammar and syntax phenomena were   introduced in a Chinese language class, and rich web resources were used in an   Italian intermediate language class. The use of digital material --- video,   audio, graphics, and text--- from the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, replaced or enhanced   traditional textbooks, and it resulted, among other things, in making the   learning experience interactive, richer and more meaningful for the students in   each of these cases. The presenters will talk about their objectives for the   integration of technology, what it accomplished in each case, and what its   impact was on student learning. They noted significant changes in student   interest levels, engagement, and attitude. This session will conclude with a   theoretically informed reflection on the use of online technology in   instruction. After all, students entering the university now are digital   natives, but faculty often are not. Presenters will explore questions such as:   Why integrate online technology in instruction at all? Does the use of   technology improve student grasp of content? Do students learn better with   online instruction? What happens in the online learning environment to the roles   of teacher and student? Why not just go with chalk-chalkboard-textbook? </p>

    <em>&ldquo;The Traipsing Mulatta and Economies of   Blackness&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>In American letters, the mulatta most often conjures   an impossibly beautiful, light-skinned, female subject who is haunted by her   mysterious past. When the narrative reveals her hidden history to include   African ancestry, the otherwise alluring markings of the mulatta&rsquo;s body become   unmistakable signifiers of an abject Black subject. This stock deployment of the   mulatta informs contemporary readings of her as a pathological trope with little   significance outside a narrowly defined literary and cultural trajectory in the   United States. I argue that rather than constituting a marginal, fixed object   lingering precariously on the edge the color line, the mulatta instead operates   as transatlantic currency for negotiating Blackness, desire and belonging in the   African Diaspora. This paper focuses on 18th- and 19th-century visual and   written representations of the signares of the Senegalese islands Gor?e and   Saint-Louis in order to consider how the mulatta&rsquo;s synchronic iterations across   the Atlantic disrupt the coherence of race and belonging in the African   Diaspora. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Naming,   Colonialism, and Everyday Life in the Congo: 1870-1960&rdquo; <br />
    </em></strong>The   naming of strangers was a long established naming convention in Central Africa,   which Africans creatively adapted to identify individual Europeans and groups of   Europeans. Notwithstanding the singularity of events and situations that   motivated the naming of Europeans, the practice worked the same way across the   village world. Africans first observed minutely Westerners&rsquo; physical appearance,   behavior, cultural practices, moral qualities and flaws, and the ways in which   they carried out their tasks of establishing the social relations of production.   They in the meantime took note of situations that Europeans individually and   collectively created. From the familiarity of their village community with   individual Europeans, Africans gained a comprehensive understanding of   colonialism, and its effects on their individual and collective experiences.   Africans then weaved and translated their observations into names, which became   not only the local identities for individual Europeans or groups of Europeans,   but also the semantic and political codes through which they now perceived,   interpreted, and understood colonialism. By naming Europeans, Africans turned a   universal practice into mnemonics, which preserved the village&rsquo;s observations,   interpretations, and representations of colonialism as pithy verbal expressions   easy to remember and transmit across localities, regions, and generations. </p>

    <em>&ldquo;Johnny Allen, Jr., A   Detroit Jazz Legend&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    Greatness is usually defined by how high   one climbs to the top of one's career, but it may also be defined by how high   one lifts up others. Detroit Jazz legend, Johnny Allen, Jr. has made a career   out of doing that. Although he is the winner of many Platinum and Gold records   for his accompanying orchestras for the Motown greats of the 1960s and ?70s;   although he is the recipient of a Grammy for his accompanying orchestration for   Isaac Hayes&rsquo; Shaft and although he has taught and mentored many local Jazz   greats, he is virtually unknown among the general population. Now four score and   ten years old, Mr. Allen stands as an example for us all, a quiet leader, the   self-effacing legend who helped put Detroit and its &ldquo;Motown&rdquo; sound on the map.   His story is worth hearing ? his childhood influences, his musical formation,   his influence on American pop music, and his motivation to give back to his   community.<br />

      A reading from (Re)vision of a Life: My   Mother's Holocaust Story . . .<br />
    </em></strong>About a year before her 1939   departure from Germany, my mother Golda Seidner, her brothers Bernhard and   Hermann, and Hermann's wife Eva, and my grandmother Rosa were expelled from   Germany to Poland. Although Rosa and Aaron (d. 1935) Seidner had lived in   Germany for many years, their children were born in Germany, and they considered   themselves fully German without any intention ever to live in Poland, they were   all deemed Polish citizens under German law because Rosa and Aaron had been born   in Poland. </p>
  <p>They were deported to the Polish border town of Zbaszyn, located near the   German border town of Neu-Benschen, in late October 1938. Zbaszyn was the site   of a work camp for displaced Jews from Germany. The Germans estimate that   between 15,000 and 17,000 Jews were forcibly expelled and dumped at the Polish   border between October 27 and 31, 1938. While Zbaszyn was not one of the better   known camps that would later draw worldwide attention to the evil brutality of   the Nazi regime, it was the first and largest one established for the expulsion   of Jews from Germany. <br />

    <em>&ldquo;Ideology and Economic Development&rdquo;</em></strong><br />
    The study   of development began in earnest with concern for economic conditions of former   colonies, and of Western Europe, after WW II. Although the field has had   successes and failures, it has drawn the attention of economists and others who   believe their work will be useful to citizens of the world&rsquo;s developing   countries. Though dimmed by the current administration&rsquo;s military-based foreign   policy, students of development remain somewhat optimistic. They generally   support the Millennium Development Goals endorsed by 189 countries of the United   Nations in September 2000, and tend to agree that development is more about   societal than about economic change. The goal of development, that is, is to   develop responsive political institutions, in a context of expanding economies   that provide fairly distributed opportunities and programs that minimize   individual deprivations and poverty. <br />
    This paper argues that increasing U.S.   development programs will achieve two goals?aiding people of developing   countries (in particular, those least fortunate) and increasing prospects for   world peace and our national security. Is also suggests a mechanism for   expanding U.S. development to accomplish these goals, by establishing   development as an effective alternative to militaristic options.<br />

    <em>&ldquo;Four Models of the Religion and   Politics Interface: China, Iran, Turkey, the USA&rdquo;<br />
      <br />
    </em>From </strong>long   before the prophet Natham chastised King David, rulers and religious leaders   have been in each other faces. The recent resurgence of conservative religious   movements has led to new tensions in the religion-politics interface. This talk   will focus on four countries chosen because they provide such different models   of the interface.</p>
  <p>In China, although most citizens are not very religious, the main critic of   the government has been the outlawed Falun Gong movement. The secular government   tolerates but carefully controls five recognized religions. In this model the   government has all the power.</p>
  <p>In Iran, the Islamic Revolution resulted in a system in which religious   leaders have veto power over all government decisions. Here, the clerics have   the final say.</p>
  <p>In Turkey, the people revere Ataturk, but are slowly moving away from his   vision of a modern, westernized Islamic state. The military enforces secularism,   but finds that increasingly difficult. Turkey is torn between Islamic resurgence   and its desire to get into the EU.</p>
  <p>In the USA, the official separation of religion and politics has been   compromised by the strong conservative Christian influence on the Republican   Party.<br />

        <em>&ldquo;Poems of Russia, Israel and Germany&rdquo;<br />
        </em>Wide Awake in   Someone Else's Dream<em> </em></strong>is a collection of traveling poems   written in Russia, Israel, Germany, and China that take the reader on a   contemplative journey through both the geography of these countries and their   cultures as well as through the inward mind of the narrator. As Liebler travels   the world, he wrestles with themes of self-discovery, spirituality, identity,   and change, and renders poems in his signature raw and defiant style. Thoughtful   and direct, these poems look toward beauty and contemplation in a bitter world   that has become fraught with mistrust and misunderstanding.</p>
  <p><strong>Wide Awake in Someone Else's Dream </strong>is divided into four   sections, the first three of which are set in specific locales?Russia, Germany,   and Jerusalem. The final section is not limited to a single geographic location   but still finds Liebler traveling through different lands and the resultant   emotions of dislocation, alienation, and vulnerability that his surroundings   provoke. Throughout this collection Liebler's poems touch on issues of political   upheaval, exploitation, and corruption and look at the personal and spiritual   transformation left in their wake. This ability to give readers a glimpse of a   bleak global reality translated by a hopeful eye has earned Liebler's poems   comparisons to the richly imagistic and spiritual work of George Trakl. </p>
  <p>In all, this collection is characterized by its calm and powerful voice,   which has a musical sensibility in its spare and straightforward   presentation.</p>

    </strong>&ldquo;Antichrist of wit: Religious and Cultural Authority in   Poe&rsquo;s Dunciad&rdquo;<br />
    Alexander Pope is generally identified as an authoritative   voice for Western cultural dominance, writing at the cusp of Renaissance   humanism and Enlightenment rationalism. As an English Catholic writing at that   particular historical point, however, Pope consciously writes as one who is both   citizen and colonized subject. To some extent marginalized within his own   culture, Pope creates himself as its author and authorizer, putting himself at a   mythical centre. As heir to both Renaissance humanism and British imperialism,   Pope is imaginatively rooted in the translatio imperii and translatio studii, or   the transference of global cultural authority from Rome to Britain. As an   English recusant, Pope appropriates and revises this master narrative of Western   civilization and British cultural dominance, and with it, the discourse of   British nationhood, in significant ways. He plays on the multiple significance   of Rome as a symbol, creating ironic resonances around the notion of imperium,   and suggesting conflicting layers of cultural authority and material power.</p>
  <p>The Dunciad is centrally concerned with cultural and spiritual authority. It   is structured as a parody of the two defining narratives of Western   civilisation: the classical translatio imperii, and the defining events of   Judaeo-Christian history, from Creation to Apocalypse. Less commonly observed is   the extent to which The Dunciad exploits the anti-Catholic rhetoric of British   nationalism in this period. The Dunciad is steeped in the rhetoric of   anti-popery and works at all levels?linguistically, structurally, and   paratextually--to turn that rhetoric against itself. This paper explores the   precision with which Pope utilizes the rhetoric and culture of anti-Catholicism,   from the intricacies of theological debate to the crudity of public spectacle,   in the Dunciad&rsquo;s eschatological account. He works to blur and disrupt the binary   oppositions on which the construction of British Protestant identity depended,   and to suggest an alternate civilized authority associated with enlightened   Catholicism, together with a model of British nationhood that can accommodate   recusant beliefs.<br />

    &ldquo;Years of Change: Hedwig Dohm&rsquo;s Become the Woman You   Are (1894)&rdquo;</strong><br />
    The German word for menopause, Wechseljahre, translates   literally as &ldquo;years of change,&rdquo; and is echoed by the more euphemistic English   term, &ldquo;the Change.&rdquo; Current titles available through amazon.com and its German   counterpart, amazon.de, emphasize the potential for positive change held by   these years signaling the end of a woman&rsquo;s reproductive cycle: These include the   2006 titles Hei?e Jahre. Voller Energie durch die Wechseljahre (Hot Years: Full   of Energy through the Years of Change) and Christine Northrup&rsquo;s The Wisdom of   Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change,   which has also been translated into German. Reflecting the confluence of   feminism and medical research, one can also find titles such as the 2002 Double   Menopause: What to Do When Both You and Your Mate Have Hormonal Changes   Together. While such titles clearly belong to the ubiquitous genre of self-help   books, they can also be read as responses to the assumption that a woman&rsquo;s   vocation, and thus her value, was associated with her physical function and   especially with her childbearing capacity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Neither this assumption nor critiques of it are new to the twenty-first   century, of course, or even to the twentieth. This presentation will examine   ways in which German author and polemicist Hedwig Ohm's 1894 novella, Werde, die   du bist (Become the Woman You Are), and her 1902 essay collection, The   Antifeminists, critique accounts of women&rsquo;s ageing offered by   late-nineteenth-century psychiatric texts. Paul Julius M?bius insisted in 1900   that women inevitably lose their intellectual powers as they age, and Emil   Kraepelin offered in his psychiatric textbooks a clinical account of the   connection between menopause and female madness and especially female   melancholia. Dohm, while taking seriously the mind-body relationship, criticized   the societal constraints and attitudes that led to breakdowns in women at the   end of their childbearing years and the failure of psychiatry to ask the right   questions that would be necessary to help women heal.<br />

    <em>&ldquo;Narrative by Other   Means&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>Alluding to Karl von Clausewitz last autumn struck me as   a bit naughty and amusing, though events in my own life in the last months   perhaps provide a warning: be careful what quotations you tweak.<br />
    <br />
    As an   undergraduate, I perused my poetic output, and determined that, if I could do   American literature no other service, I could, at least, avoid writing any more   poetry. And I stayed true to that vow, but for certain occasional verses for   weddings or birthdays, for thirty years. As happens with many novelists on the   downward side of fifty, however, poetry began to appeal to me again. It can be,   after all, so. . . short. And a series of personal losses?the deaths of my   mother and brother-in-law, of various friends?along with the ongoing debacle in   the Middle East pushed me back toward this genre I long ago abandoned.<br />

    I   discovered too that certain narratives perhaps lent themselves more easily to   poems than I had imagined, whether brief or more extensive. And, too, I found   that much of the world around me invited a literary expression that was most   appropriately approached in a lyric, and that a story could be told, in its way,   in a dozen lines or less.<br />
    <br />
    I remain a tyro in poetry. Having so long ago   left it aside, my influences, such as they are, are a grab-bag of works   half-remembered or of those which, for one reason or another, I picked up on   somebody&rsquo;s recommendation. Hence, beyond such usual suspects as Whitman and   Auden, there are moments when Vachel Linday or Edgar Lee Masters or even Stephen   Vincent Benet rear up. Thom Gunn I always read and admired, though perhaps most   striking of all, at least in my early efforts, was the impact of the iambic   pentameter of the Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights I had so admired in my   student days.<strong><em><br />

    <em>&ldquo;Teaching Mathematics to the   Scared&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>The expectation in a research I university is academic   rigor and excellence. The expectation in an urban university surrounded by a   city with the highest adult illiteracy rate in the nation is community   empowerment through the education of non-traditional students. These   expectations account for an unusually diverse student body at Wayne with people   at both ends of the academic spectrum. This diversity is most keenly expressed   in student performance in meeting the Math Competency requirement and   particularly impacts the graduation of adult and students from specific ethnic   groups in non-math intensive majors. Meeting the apparently conflicting missions   at Wayne may require a diversity of pedagogical approaches tailored to the   academic level and learning styles of diverse student groups if all are to   succeed.<br />
    <br />
    Math for the Scared represents a course originally developed to   serve students in the Interdisciplinary Studies and in the Chicano-Boricua   Studies programs. The pedagogical evolution of this course and the gradual   development of an integrated learning community involving students, advisors,   tutors, and peer mentors with the instructor as orchestra leader for the   learning enterprise will be traced along with student performance in instruments   used to measure math competency<br />
    <br />
    Specific examples of conceptual   development in arithmetic that may impact later learning in algebra will be   presented along with more visually based instructional materials. Impediments to   success will be discussed along with approaches to help students overcome some   of them. Students from the class may also be present to provide an independent   perspective on the experience. Lastly a plea will be made for the creation of   instruments and testing conditions to meet a given standard that can more   effectively measure student learning for a diverse student   group.<strong><em><br />

    <em>&ldquo;The Impact of   Trauma on Disability Adjustment and Coping&rdquo;<br />
      </em></strong>Research indicates   that an individual who experiences a trauma or is part of a traumatic event   develops major psychological, social and vocational issues. The level and   severity of the impact the individual experiences is dependent upon the type of   trauma, nature of the condition, the individual personality, the meaning   attributed to the event and the degree of family, community and social support   available. Research shows that approximately 20 million individuals experiences   some form of trauma due to disasters, violence or physical and emotional   disability each year in the United States. This talk will address issues related   to the impact of trauma and the strategies that can be utilized to effect   change.<br />
    <br />
    Learning Objectives <br />
    (1) Knowledge base in issues related to   trauma, such as the trauma schema, adaptive capacities of individual response,   Intrinsic and Extrinsic factors that affect adjustment and coping, cognitive and   psychological factors that affect coping; <br />
    (2) To understand the long-term   effects of trauma on adjustment and coping and the complex issues associated   with treatment and interventions in addressing life-long problems; <br />
    (3)   Increase awareness regarding the diverse and cultural aspects related to trauma,   coping and adjustment. <strong><em><br />

    <em>&ldquo;Constructing and Contesting the   American Century&rdquo;<br />
    </em></strong>As a discursive formation first articulated   in 1941 by magazine owner-editor, Henry Luce, the &quot;American Century&quot; served as   an ideological cover for US global hegemony. This presentation will first   briefly examine those institutional arrangements and political-military policies   embedded in the American Century and, in the aftermath of declining US hegemony   and the demise of the Soviet Empire, the re-articulated New American Century.   The presentation will then consider those counter-discursive formations,   identified as the European, post-colonial, and post-modern moments, and their   contestation of US hegemony in order to determine the degree to which they   challenge the American Century through alternative or counter-hegemonic   perspectives and practices.</p>
