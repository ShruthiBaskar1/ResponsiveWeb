      <em>&quot;Saintly Idiocy and Contemplative   Empowerment: The Case for Dame Gertrude More&quot;</em></strong><br />
      <br />
      This lecture   deals with the life and writings of a seventeenth-century English nun who was   the great-great granddaughter of Sir Thomas More. At the age of eighteen, Dame   Gertrude More went to the Benedictine convent her father helped establish in the   Spanish Netherlands, and in which she assumed a leadership role. After an   initial period of struggle, in which she could not wholeheartedly accept her   life as a cloistered nun, she discovered with the help of her spiritual mentor,   Dom Augustine Baker, a form of contemplative prayer that suited and satisfied   her?though she opposed the abbess and vicar of the convent who wished to impose   on her and the other nuns a Jesuit meditative practice. She died at the age of   thirty-three, leaving a body of writing in verse and prose that was later   published as The Spiritual Exercises Of the most vertuous and religious D.   Gertrude More of the holy order of S. Bennet and English congregation of our   Ladies of Comfort in Cambray, she called them. Amor ordinem nescit. And Ideots   deuotions. Her only spiritual father and directour the ven. Fa. Baker stiled   them. Confessiones Amantis. A louers confessions (Paris, 1658). Although   feminist historical scholarship has been slower to recover the devotional   writing of early modern Englishwomen than to rediscover the more obviously   transgressive, though sometimes quite atypical, texts of such women as Eleanor   Davies, Anna Trapnel, and Margaret Cavendish, who functioned more boldly in the   public sphere, scholars are beginning see the value of studying the religious   writings of other women, especially Catholic nuns, both within the context of   gender politics of the time and within the large cultural processes of early   modern England and Europe. Dame Gertrude More&rsquo;s work is the product of an   independent intelligence and courageous temperament. She herself was at once   humbly pious and boldly assertive, exploiting the surprising possibilities for   personal freedom and independence that were possible within a rule-bound,   cloistered way of life.<br />

      &quot;Literacy as a Social Divide: African Americans at the   Crossroads&quot;</em></strong><br />
      <br />
      The United States is in the midst of a literacy   crisis. Illiteracy rates, particularly among African Americans and other   minority groups, are profoundly troubling and demand innovative solutions. Those   solutions must not, however, merely focus on the traditional skills of &ldquo;reading,   writing, and arithmetic&rdquo; (though these are certainly needed). An effective   bridge must be built across America&rsquo;s social divide ? a deep chasm rooted in   racism and the excesses of our capitalistic system. Literacy is both a casualty   of American social structures and one of our best hopes for altering these   structures. In light of this, we are forced to ask the questions, &ldquo;Why is it   that, in one of the world&rsquo;s most developed nations, illiteracy is so pervasive   and literacy is difficult to achieve? And why is its achievement especially   difficult for African Americans, a group that has long sought literacy as a   means to political and economic empowerment?&rdquo; This International Literacy Week   presentation, Literacy as a Social Divide, will seek to answer two questions   that cut to the heart of this burning issue. First, why are literacy disparities   between blacks and whites increasing despite growth in literacy access and   achievement in past decades particularly in urban centers such as Detroit?   Second, why have efforts at literacy improvement on the national and local   levels not made a significant impact given the fact that it is a feature on   policy makers&rsquo; agendas? This presentation will also shed light on Detroit&rsquo;s   current literacy impasse and where the city stands relative to its suburban   counterparts. </p>

    <em>&quot;Politics, Religion, and   American Constitutional Values</em></strong><em>&quot;</em><br />
    <br />
    In this   presentation, Professor Sedler will explore politics and religion from the   perspective of constitutional values. Religious freedom is a very important   value in the American constitutional system. The First Amendment gives double   protection to religious freedom by means of both an Establishment Clause and a   Free Exercise Clause. The First Amendment provides strong protection to freedom   of speech, which includes, of course, the speech of religious officials and   religious institutions. It cannot be doubted that in the United States today,   religion is very important to large numbers of Americans, and for this reason   religion may be expected to play a role in American politics.</p>
  <p align="left">But what should this role be? Professor Sedler maintains that some   guidance may be found from the values embodied in a little known provision in   the original Constitution, the prohibition of a test oath for holding federal   office. Art. VI, sec. 3 provides that, &quot;no religious Test shall ever be required   as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.&quot;   Professor Sedler submits that in light of the values embodied in the   constitutional prohibition against test oaths, a candidate&rsquo;s religious beliefs   should be deemed irrelevant in the political process. For voters to take a   candidate&rsquo;s religious beliefs into account and to vote against a candidate   because the candidate&rsquo;s religion differs from their own is the equivalent of a   religious test for public office and so is inconsistent with the constitutional   values embodied in Art. VI, sec. 3. Moreover, the prohibition against religious   tests for holding public office also means that candidates who run for public   office, and who, when elected, have promised to support the Constitution, must   be assumed to be able to separate their own religious beliefs from their   constitutional duty to govern impartially in a pluralistic society and   religiously neutral governmental system.</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Sedler contends that because of the values embodied in   the constitutional provision against test oaths, we should be troubled by the   fact that some candidates for public office have used a reverse test oath, so to   speak. They have run to some extent on their religious beliefs and have made   blatant appeals to some religious groups to support them on the basis of shared   religious beliefs. The clear implication is that their religious beliefs will   shape their views on questions of public policy. Professor Sedler will discuss   how the matter of running on religious beliefs has occurred in the past and is   playing out in the current election cycle </p>
  <p align="left">Finally, Professor Sedler will discuss the role of religious   adherents and religious institutions in trying to advance their religious   beliefs through political activity. Here he maintains that the constitutional   values of religious freedom and freedom of speech interact so that religious   people and religious institutions are acting in accordance with constitutional   values when they try to advance their religious-based beliefs through political   activity. Similarly, it comes within the free exercise of religion for members   of the clergy to remind their adherents of the tenets of their faith, and to   contend, if they so believe, that as a matter of religious belief, their   adherents should support or oppose certain public policies and candidates who   support or oppose those policies. The point where constitutional values may come   between members of the clergy and adherents of their faith is when members of   the clergy demand that their adherents who are holding public office conform   their actions to the religious beliefs of their faith. A very recent example of   this situation occurred when the Archbishop of Kansas City, Kansas, directed   that priests refuse communion to Kansas Governor Katherine Sibelius because of   her refusal to sign a law restricting abortion. Such an action is completely   inconsistent with the principle that government officials must be able to   separate their own religious beliefs from their views on matters of public   policy.</p>

    <strong><em>&quot;The Impact of Church-base Politicized Social   Capital on Black Political Activism&quot;</em></strong><br />
    <br />
    This study seeks to   examine the relationship between church-based politicized social capital   resources (e.g. social issues and political messages) and political activism   among black Americans. Our results suggest that exposure to social issues (e.g.   racism, poverty, immigration, war, and police brutality) in one&rsquo;s house of   worship propels blacks to engage in political activism largely because such   issues are politicized so to encourage activism. That is, on average, exposure   to social issues in church increases political activism among blacks. However,   when exposure to messages that encourage congregants to engage in political   activism are also taken into account, only exposure to political messages   predicts political activism.</p>

    <strong><em>&quot;Native Stereotypes and   Quebec Nationalism in Robert Lalonde's The Last Indian   Summer&quot;</em></strong><br />
    <br />
    Stereotyping of Native characters in Quebec fiction   began with its origins in the 19th century, and continues to be prevalent today.   This stereotype consists of both positive portrayals ? where the native is wise,   brave, lives in harmony with his environment, and is the faithful guide of the   white man as he makes his way in a hostile natural environment ? and negative   ones, where the Native is violent, unpredictable and hostile to white occupation   of his territory. Previously, ideological interpretations were given to the   negative and positive aspects of the stereotype, linking the first to   demonstrations of superior French Canadian civilization, and the last to the   oppressive colonial regime imposed by the British on both Quebec and its   Natives. In today's talk, I will be using Homi Bhabha's theory of ambivalence in   colonial relations to explore how the stereotyped Native contributes to a   nuanced articulation of Qu?b?cois nationalism in Robert Lalonde's 1982 novel, <em>The Last Indian Summer </em>. Specifically, I will be showing how the   novel's narrator, a Quebec adolescent, both uses the figure of the Native   rhetorically to argue for a more inclusive form of nationalism, but ultimately   excludes this figure through narrative structures as he reconciles himself with   his French Catholic identity.<br />

    Is the printed scholarly   monograph doomed to extinction? The digital revolution for journal articles is   over?digital won. The situation for scholarly books is somewhat different, in   part because of the difficulty of reading an entire book on computer screens or   e-book readers. </p>
  <p align="left">Nonetheless, budget pressures, including the need to fund digital   resources, have reduced support for book purchases in most academic research   libraries. Many university presses have lost their subsidies and publish fewer   copies of accepted manuscripts since libraries have less money to buy them. The   blurring of lines between in-print and out-of-print in the Internet marketplace   for books means that perhaps libraries don't need to purchase scholarly   monographs &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; but can wait to purchase them &ldquo;just in time.&rdquo; Finally,   faculty may now depend less on libraries for books because they can often   purchase out-of-print copies cheaply, get them in days rather than weeks, mark   them up, and keep them forever. </p>
  <p align="left">How do all these factors affect scholars in the Humanities? Is the   &ldquo;tenure&rdquo; book still a reasonable possibility for specialized research topics   with limited marketability? </p>

    &quot;Eighteenth-Century Celebrated Cases&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><span target="_blank">In 1734 Fran?ois Gayot de Pitaval, a French   lawyer originally from Lyon, published what would become the first of 20 volumes   of his <em><span target="_blank">Celebrated and Interesting Court   Cases</span></em> (1734-43). With his collection of Celebrated Cases, Pitaval   launched a trend in literature about crime that spread from France to Germany   and England. Such collections remained the fashion well into the nineteenth   century. </span></p>
  <p align="left"><span target="_blank">In this brown bag talk, Professor Duggan   will consider Gayot de Pitaval&rsquo;s Celebrated Court Cases as a form of <em><span target="_blank">pedagogical fiction</span></em> by taking into account the ways   in which he frames his collections of cases and transforms legal accounts,   looking at the particular case of &ldquo;The False Martin Guerre,&rdquo; his first published   case. The talk will consider the ways in which legal discourse of the period   already was &ldquo;literary,&rdquo; and how Pitaval further exploits the literariness of   sensationalist court cases to entertain as well as instruct a public consisting   not of his peers, but of Parisian socialites. The popularity of the genre cannot   be separated from the development of a <em><span target="_blank">secular </span></em>public sphere in which crime was being framed and perceived less and   less in terms of sin, magic, and Satan, and in which knowledge of the law was   becoming increasingly important.</span><br />

    &quot;<em>More or Less White: Mestizo Identities and Indian Resurgence   in Ecuador</em></strong>&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">This talk will explore the impact of Ecuador's indigenous movement   on non-indigenous understandings of race and ethnicity. The category of mestizo,   as contrasted with indigenous, has become the &quot;more or less white&quot; side of an   overarching mestizo vs. indigenous dichotomy. Mestizo was previously one   category in an array of non-indigenous categories but has absorbed other   categories. This transformation limits the reach of the indigenous movement's   challenge to the supremacy of whiteness. Indigenous power and a new discourse of   intercultural respect have pushed overt racism out of everyday interactions.   However, the shift from older racial discourses to multiculturalism has been   deceptively easy. Ironically, this shift has left &quot;less white&quot; mestizos without   a discursive basis for linking their experiences of discrimination with   indigenous experiences and struggles.<br />

    <em>&quot;Science and Violence: The Murder of   Clothilde Marchand and The Trials of Lila Jimerson&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p align="left">This paper examines a once-famous murder in Buffalo, New York in   1930 in which a Cayuga Indian, Lila Jimerson, was accused of murdering Clothilde   Marchand, wife of Jimerson&rsquo;s lover, Henri Marchand. Although the murder and   subsequent trials were quickly forgotten, at the time they captured the public   imagination locally, nationally and internationally. The haste with which the   trial was held (it began two weeks after the murder), the dramatic events of the   trial itself, the intervention of the United States Attorney for the defense,   and extensive coverage in local, national and international newspapers and   magazines, all suggest the cultural and political importance felt at that   moment.<br />
    <br />
    The murder put more than the alleged murderer on trial; the   murder and trials raised questions about the nature and meaning of science,   questions in which the authority of modern science was challenged by what it had   consigned to the past. One locus of that authority was the new museum of science   building which had opened officially only a year prior to the murder; it had   been hailed as triumph of civic order and the confluence of intellectual and   material progress. In addition to the museum itself, news reports throughout the   late 1920s had focused on the work of Henri Marchand, who had been hired to   prepare exhibits for the new building. Uniformly described as a world famous   artist whose very presence in Buffalo validated the importance of the museum and   the city, Marchand and the confluence of art and science in his work were said   to demonstrate the triumph of progress and science. In particular, Marchand had   created a diorama of &ldquo;prehistoric Seneca Indians&rdquo; which featured a bare-breasted   woman, the model for which was Lila Jimerson. The diorama had legitimated an   evolutionary model of progress, one visible not just in it, but structured into   the very design of the museum, a model that made science the guarantor of   historical development.<br />
    <br />
    At the same time, however, the murder, trials,   and enormous publicity reveal complex and even contradictory ideas about science   and the world, in particular about the meaning of evolution. These competing   ideas become visible when one traces the history of the museum, a process which   includes how the museum came into being, how the building was funded, how it was   designed, and how the work of Henri Marchand was described and praised. <br />
    <br />
    Specifically, the arguments for building the museum, the design of the   building, the network of relations between the Buffalo museum and other   institutions, and the exhibits within the museum offered multiple and competing   versions of evolution which become visible through the prism offered by the   murder, trial and publicity. Evolution did so in large part because a main means   for transmitting evolution to the larger public was through the eugenics   movement, itself having one of its homes in science museums. Progress and its   handmaiden science were popular and elite, democratic and authoritarian, and   inclusive and restrictive. Ultimately, Lila Jimerson was not the sole being on   trial.</p>

    <em>&quot;The Challenge and Opportunity of an   Aging Society&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p>According to recent data complied by the AARP, nearly ninety-percent of older   adults (defined as those over the age of fifty) prefer to age in place.[1] Aging   in place is a concept describing the ability of seniors and elderly adults to   stay in their homes despite any onset of physical and/or mental health   difficulties that may occur during the process of growing older.[2] As a result,   aging in place has created a phenomenon known as, naturally occurring retirement   communities (NORCs). <br />
    <br />
    First termed by Dr. Michael E. Hunt at the   University of Wisconsin, NORCs refer to neighborhoods where a disproportionate   number of seniors and elderly reside in the same place.[3] These living   environments differ from continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs), such as   assisted living facilities, and leisure oriented retirement communities (LORCs),   which are planned and developed to specifically cater to seniors of a certain   age who move to these communities for health reasons or recreational incentives,   respectively. NORCs however are not planned. They are not manufactured   neighborhoods or constructed housing developments. NORCs are currently evolving   organically, specifically in suburban areas, as the same demographic which   helped to generate and define the suburban lifestyle (baby boomers) now chooses   to age in place in their homes - within the neighborhoods they built and   cherish.<br />
    <br />
    As seniors continue to age in place, the paper will assert that   local governments need to prepare for both physical environment adjustments and   additional senior service provisions to specifically address the many needs a   sizeable aging population will present. This paper will set the national   demographic context (current and projected) with a detailed analysis of a large   metropolitan area.[4] Framed by existing knowledge and supplemented field   research, the study will discuss the community characteristics of successful   aging in place. The third part of our paper focuses on a review and assessment   of ways in which planning, zoning and design, at the level of the municipality,   can be employed to the processes of aging in place and the establishment of   successful NORCs. </p>

    <em>&quot;Trauma Sells: Reflections on the Popular Appeal of   Trauma Narratives&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p align="left">After briefly outlining the book project on &quot;Memory and Trauma as   Research Paradigms in Cultural Studies&quot; to contextualize the subject of the   presentation, the talk will explore the development of &lsquo;trauma culture&rsquo; in which   everyone who suffers is (fallaciously) ascribed victim status, victims began to   be revered when ascribed the social function of juridico-historical witness yet,   since they are also associated with weakness, they are increasingly   re-conceptualized as survivors. While depictions of traumatizing victimization   are not inherently appealing, when transformed into melodramatic spectacles of   violence and/or redemptive-sentimental trauma kitsch and ascribed the capacity   to provide moral enlightenment and imbue the audiences with the authenticity   they find lacking in their own mundane lives, particularly the new sub-genre of   trauma memoirs became so successful that increasingly so-called trauma invention   stories are entering the market. The conceptual reflections will be illustrated   by a brief analysis of how the popular German Weltbild book catalogue markets   trauma kitsch memoirs.</p>

    <em>&quot;</em></strong><em><strong>Labor and the Memory of   Justice&quot;</strong></em></p>
  <p align="left">This paper rethinks how social justice was understood in the labor   movement and on the U.S. left during the first half of the twentieth century. It   examines the active memory of justice in the labor movement and how it shaped   the labor movement's struggles in a time of institutional change. Lacking any   state means to mediate workplace disputes and community conflicts and subject to   the often hostile court judges, working-class activists had to imagine   alternative ways to achieve justice for workers and the working class. Labor   radical Elizabeth Gurley Flynn articulated such strategies in her memoir, <em>Rebel Girl</em>, when she discussed different legal cases; but she was not   alone in understanding the legal system as one in which justice might be earned   as well as denied. &quot;Making plans to get justice,&quot; to use the words of one   worker, also required re-imagining what &quot;justice&quot; might mean outside the   machinery of law. Understanding justice,as Flynn understood, involves not only   active contemporary observation but also memory.</p>

    <em>&quot;Promoting Afro-Brazilian Culture and History   in a Racial Democracy: An Analysis of the Fundacao Cultural   Palmares&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p align="left">This lecture will examine the origins and evolution of the   Funda??o Cultural Palmares/FCP (Palmares Cultural Foundation). On August 22,   1988, the Brazilian government created the FCP to work with educational,   governmental, and private institutions to increase public awareness of   Afro-Brazilian contributions to Brazilian society and culture. The Palmares   foundation publishes materials (books, magazines, and newsletters) by and about   Afro-Brazilians. It is the main sponsor of Black cultural and educational events   in Brazil. The foundation&rsquo;s leaders regularly travel throughout the country   lecturing on diverse aspects of the Afro-Brazilian experience. <br />
    <br />
    The   foundation has always been housed within the Ministry of Culture. When the   President of the Republic and the Minister of Culture are supportive, the   foundation has more resources and is more active. In other situations, the   foundation has struggled and even had to fight for its survival. <br />
    <br />
    The   emphasis on culture has been intensely opposed by many Black activists who   wanted more focus on improving the socio-economic conditions of Afro-Brazilians.   By promoting the explicit inclusion, recognition, and celebration of   Afro-Brazilian history and culture, leaders and staffers of the Palmares   foundation have challenged the Brazilian myth of racial democracy and helped   place Black Movement concerns on the country&rsquo;s political agenda.</p>

    <em>&quot;</em></strong><em><strong>Critical Regions of Global Poetics:   Shanxing Wang's Economies of Scale&quot;</strong></em></p>
  <p>In this paper, Professor Watten argues that there is an emerging   transnational style among postmodern, postnational, avant-garde, and diasporic   poets that relies on the accretion of what he terms &quot;radical particulars.&quot;   Language poetry is just one of these styles. It has been suggested by proponents   of Language poetry that a poetics of radical particularity as anti-national and   anti-identitarian, as with the earlier model of surrealism, offers a standard   for comparability among these differing traditions, even better the possibility   of solidarity. He has been arguing, on the other hand, against any such easy   transfer from one context, literature, or region to another. To develop this   claim he will apply a refunctioned, pluralist concept of &quot;critical regionalism&quot;   to new poetic genres in the avant-garde that re-map spaces of the global by   means of the negative and differential relation between particular and   universal. In developing his argument, he will present a series of eight   critical &quot;regions&quot; as re-mappings of theory and history, poetics and region, and   then develop a reading New York-based poet Shanxing Wang's first book of   experimental poetry, <em>Mad Science in Imperial City</em>. He focuses on the   ways Wang's poetics of cultural displacement and cognitive remapping intersect   with the political economy of the new China, leading to an economy of scale that   connects &quot;radical particularity&quot; and the nonplace of global capitalism. Wang's   work thus offers a reflexive, subject-centered account of the ravages of   globalization that contrasts with the ironic monumentalism of recently emerging   Chinese avant-garde and post-avant artists such as Xu Bing, Ai Wei-Wei, Cai   Guoqiang, Yue Mingjun, and Xing Danwen.</p>

    <em>&quot;Two Worlds: Reading Anglo-Jewish   Writing&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p>If Anglo-Jewish history has been marginalized, as Todd Endelman, David   Feldman, and other historians have long lamented, Anglo-Jewish literature has   also been marginal.? However, recent critics have argued for expanding the canon   to include Anglo-Jewish writers from the Enlightenment and Romantic periods to   the end of the nineteenth century and beyond, as David Levi, Emma Lyon, Grace   Aguilar, Amy Levy and Israel Zangwill have all received new readings that make   visible an Anglo-Jewish literary and intellectual tradition.? The terms on which   the Anglo-Jewish texts are brought into the canon are not self-evident and   require theoretical clarification.? One can integrate the Anglo-Jewish presence   in literature in different ways:? as a minority discourse connected to both the   dominant discourse and other minority discourses, as a transhistorical and   transnational Jewish literature, and as readable by means of a philo- and   anti-Semitic dialectic. Scrivener wants to work toward achieving critical   distance from the recent scholarship in Anglo-Jewish writing by returning to   previous generations of scholars from David Philipson in the late nineteenth   century up through the post-Holocaust work of Edgar Rosenberg and Harold Fisch.   Finally, he will illustrate some of the theoretical issues by reading the figure   of the Jewish peddler in Romantic-era Britain.? By expanding the emphasis on   belletristic literature to include cultural representations in general, one   resituates the literary to establish a broader context of meaning.? By   interpreting the Jewish peddler in the popular <em>Universal Songster</em> (1825) and the Old Bailey court transcripts, one finds images and meanings that   lead one back to belletristic literature like Shakespeare's <em>Merchant of   Venice</em> and Wordsworth's <em>The Excursion.</em></p>

    <em>&quot;What language is STOP?   Language ideology and identity in Montreal's signscape&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The province of Quebec, Canada is noted for high levels of   linguistic tension, in particular focusing on written signs, where the use of   English is legally restricted and socially stigmatized. Stop signs are a   particularly salient aspect of the 'signscape' of Montreal, Quebec, particularly   because it has a large, geographically restricted anglophone minority in several   of its independent municipalities. A pilot study in 'contemporary epigraphy'   examines 2816 stop signs in several of Montreal's anglophone and francophone   regions including quantitative analysis, a photographic database, and linguistic   content analysis.</span></p>
  <p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Variability in sign texts (STOP, </span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">ARRET,   ARRET/STOP) overlaps partially but not completely with variability in spoken   language. Despite legal? prohibitions on English signs, STOP signs persist   through an act of linguistic legerdemain, defined as French, but not 'good   French'. Because language ideologies towards bilingualism vary so greatly   between anglophone and francophone populations (and between public and private   sectors), bilingual stop signs are particularly subject to both civic-oriented   manipulation and vandalism that reflect these attitudes.</span></p>

    <em>&quot;Generative Grammar and Chinese   Pedagogy&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p align="left">Although there have always been some conflicts between the   research interests of a linguist and the pedagogical concerns of a language   teacher, their contributions could be mutually beneficial.?As someone who has   been studying linguistics and teaching Chinese over the past 12 years, I   would?like to make?efforts to bridge the gap between these two camps?and to make   the best out of the overlapping of their fields. For example, on the one   hand,?some understanding of syntactic typology?and second language acquisition   theories can help a?Chinese teacher get in? touch with the underlying   difficulties a student has to go through, and to?better systemize her teaching.   On the other hand, the mistakes made by?students can serve as good data for   linguists to open up new research fields and to comprehend languages more   introspectively. In my current project, I scrutinize the errors I have collected   from students learning Chinese and study them with the guidance of linguistic   theories. In particular, I argue that, ultimately, the definiteness of nouns,   e.g.<em><em> the apple</em></em>?vs. <em><em>an apple</em></em>,?and the   finiteness of verbs, e.g. <em><em>to help</em></em>?vs. <em><em>helped</em></em>, are responsible for many of the seemingly unrelated   challenges a student has to face. My research will benefit people who?teach,   learn, and do research on Chinese as well as?other languages.??</p>

    <em>&quot;Refugee Creativity: Poetry and Art in Palestinian   Refugee Camps</em></strong><em>&quot;</em></p>
  <p>A refugee camp may not be the first place one would look for poetry and art,   but like any place, it can reveal its treasures, often in surprising ways. </p>
  <p>I will begin with a brief photographic tour of informal and formal artwork in   the streets of the refugee camp, and in the places to which they lead. One of   these places is the literary salon where poets present their work to their   peers. While some poems concern the Palestinian nation, delayed dreams,   migration, and return home, others appeal to anyone, describing coffee, a blank   sheet of paper, a bird&rsquo;s wing, a rainy day in autumn, sleeplessness, and   thoughts on existence. Thus, while born in the refugee camp, these poems relate   to a more universal audience.</p>
  <p>We will listen in on some poetry reading sessions, focusing on poetry dealing   with the nature of poetry itself. What is its source? What is its value? We will   see how the written word, the spoken word, and the poetic tradition, complete   with innovations, intersect in works of Palestinian poets. The poets see   themselves as creating something constructive from their pains and dreams,   something that will outlive them. </p>
  <p>Baudrillard refers to how body/books repeat the thought/text, &ldquo;forming paving   stones and paths, networks of rationality through the incoherence of the   universe&rdquo; (<em>Symbolic Exchange and Death</em>, 1976, 75). In this manner,   these poems form paths moving toward coherence, and leading both inside and   outside the refugee camp.</p>

Piontek and authors   such as G?nter Grass, Heinrich B?ll, and Wolfgang Borchert felt the need to tell   their stories and often their social message, in concise, accessible terms.   Additionally, Piontek's stories frequently demonstrate the effectiveness of a   surprise ending, very much in the tradition of O'Henry and Roald Dahl. She will   read several of her stories in English translation, some of them recently   published in American magazines.

    <em>&quot;American Water Works&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p>Water is unarguably at the center of almost all of the key environmental   concerns of our time?or indeed of any time.? According to Irene Klaver, Director   of the Philosophy of Water Project at the University of North Texas, &ldquo;water has   always been intrinsically linked with culture.? Virtually all civilizations   developed around water:? tribes settled at the shores or on the banks of water   bodies, cities originated at the confluence of rivers.&rdquo; In some sense all human   civilizations, cultures, or social groups can be understood as creating <em>water works</em>?complex hydraulic assemblages for the circulation and   mediation of water. In this brown bag talk, I will sketch out the contours of a   book project I am just undertaking, which focuses on a series of major American   &ldquo;water works&rdquo; from the 19th and 20th centuries. I employ the phrase &ldquo;water   works&rdquo; not only to denote such hydraulic engineering projects as dams,   aqueducts, mills, canals, water treatment plants, or sanitation systems, but   also to account for such cultural projects as literature, paintings, maps, parks   and gardens, photographs, films, or television shows.?? In &ldquo;American Water   Works,&rdquo; I intend to put these two different kinds of water works in dialogue, to   understand the way in which the history of the United States as a hydraulic   civilization has shaped and has been shaped by the history of cultural   representations and mediations of water.? In undertaking this project my aim is   not only to produce a scholarly work in environmental studies, but also to   develop web-based and other resources for the study of American &ldquo;water works.&rdquo;?   I would be particularly interested in the prospect of collaborating with other   humanists, scientists, engineers, or social scientists engaged in water-related   research projects. </p>

    <em>&quot;Mathematical Representation and Theory   Choice</em></strong><em>&quot;</em></p>
  <p>Much recent work within the philosophy of science has focused on various   features of modeling and the representation of scientific theories.? This paper   investigates how the mathematical formulations of scientific theories and the   mathematical representation of measurements figure in theory confirmation.? In   particular, it is argued that structural features of such representations yield   at least a partial response to Thomas Kuhn&rsquo;s claim that there are no objective   grounds for comparing and choosing between different theoretical paradigms.?   This reply to Kuhn enjoys several advantages over others in the philosophical   literature.? Einstein&rsquo;s theory of gravitation, and its test via the 1919 eclipse   observations, which were regarded as offering support for it over the Newtonian   theory, will be discussed as an illustration.? Although the paper concerns the   use of mathematics in theory formulation and confirmation, the talk will be   relatively non-technical and is intended for a general audience.</p>

The younger sister of the novelist and playwright Thornton   Wilder, she taught at Wheaton and Smith Colleges in the 1920s, worked with the   Federal Writer's Project, and was arrested for supporting union efforts in   Gastonia, North Carolina in 1929.? Individual poems appeared in <em>Atlantic   Monthly, Commonweal, The New York Times, The Nation, Poetry, </em>and <em>The   Saturday Review of Literature. </em>Wilder achieved authentic experiments in   modern poetry, and her work has been almost completely overlooked in criticism   with the exception of favorable contemporary reviews of her books.?

  <p>Participation in clinical trials requires the informed consent of patients,   and recruitment to trials may be the most highly regulated physician-patient   interaction in academic medical centers.? Little is known, however, about the   details of this interaction because few studies have been based on data   collected from actual recruitment encounters.? Based on such prospective data,   the purpose of this study was to describe how physicians present key elements of   consent in offers to participate in clinical trials, including offers to   minority patients.? A discourse analysis found that oncologists appear to   present elements of consent selectively and persuasively, with some differences   across ethnicity.? From the perspective of contemporary bioethics, persuasion in   offers to participate in clinical trials can be regarded as ethically   problematic, perhaps even rising to the standard of undue influence as defined   in <em>The Belmont Report</em> and federal regulations (45 CFR 46).? From the   perspective of traditional medical ethics, however, persuasion in offers to   participate in clinical trials can be regarded as ethically appropriate, perhaps   fulfilling the Hippocratic obligation to provide the best possible care to   patients.? In this talk, I hope to generate discussion of ethical issues in   offers to participate in clinical trials based on naturally-occurring data</p>

    <em>&quot;Structuring the World: The Politicization of the   Peasant in Late Qing China &quot; </em></strong></p>
  <p align="left">Chinese intellectuals viewed the peasant in many different ways   during the first half of the twentieth century: backwards, ignorant, innocent,   holding China back, and even powerful. The focus of this paper, however, is the   emergence of the peasant as a political and revolutionary subject within Chinese   discourse, an emergence that first took place during the last decade of the Qing   Dynasty (1644-1911). This is most clear in the writings of   anti-Manchu-activist-turned-anarchist Liu Shipei, who was the first to theorize   peasant revolution at the beginning of China's twentieth century and is the   subject of this paper. Liu only came to promote the revolutionary potential of   the peasantry once he came to see the world as a totality structured by colonial   power relations, creating a new way of relating politics to history. Thus began   the political sequence of China's short twentieth century (1901-1976). How the   figure of the peasant has been located by Chinese intellectuals across that   twentieth century is less to do with elite discrimination, the legitimation of   power politics, or even state-society relations than the difficult trajectory of   China's historical transition in relation to its colonial encounter with   capitalist modernity.</p>

  <p>Through the analysis of the autobiographies of African American women   involved in the Black Panther Party, findings suggest nuanced responses to   situations when the exigence is race and when the exigence is gender.? When   their experiences with racial oppression led them to perceive race as dangerous,   their response was to engage in racial justice organizations.? Through their   involvement in these organizations, gender oppression was perceived as competing   with that of race.? Their response to gender oppression in black organizations   was either to withdraw from the source of conflict or change their   organizational alignment. This work continues the process of deconstructing the   myth of social movement experiences as monolithic and challenges the notion a   single overarching master status with which activists must align.</p>

    <em>&quot;Building Black Power: Independent Unionism,   Community Control, and Detroit&rsquo;s Organizing Tradition,   1967-1970&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p align="left">Scholars of the &ldquo;long civil rights movement&rdquo; have greatly enhanced   our understanding of the complexities, scope and grassroots orientation of   African American freedom struggles.? Until quite recently, however, &ldquo;long   movement&rdquo; historians have tended to ignore or downplay the differences that   emerged between local civil rights and black power activists. My paper   challenges this approach by presenting a case study of efforts to secure   community control of federally funded construction projects, urban   redevelopment, and labor organizing in Detroit following the 1967 rebellion.   Detroit&rsquo;s Black Power movement developed a grassroots-based organizing tradition   in post-rebellion Detroit.? This movement sought to create a means for black   workers and communities to independently represent and pursue their own   interests and agendas.? In particular, a number of independent organizations and   institutions were formed to gain control of all aspects of inner city   construction and development.? These efforts, as my paper will show, were part   of a much broader effort to wrest control of the local movement away from civil   rights unionists and leaders who had increasingly become identified as part of   the problem rather than the solution.? </p>

    <em>&quot;The West African Conception of Person especially   among the Adja Fon of Southern Republic of Benin and the Yoruba of Southwestern   Nigeria and Its Impact upon Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santer?a in the   Caribbean&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p>The concept of &ldquo;person&rdquo; is fundamental to the study of religion. It underlies   the cosmology and eschatology of the dogma; myths and rituals, creed and ethos   of religious practices. It contributes to the construct of the sacred and   profane, their separation and/or intertwining. It sheds light upon spirituality   as individual response to dimensions of life considered as transcendent to   material contingencies. Person in this regard is a mythical discourse which   bridges the gap between various internal and external frontiers and establishes   human identity. In the West African cultures, especially among the Adja Fon of   southern Benin and the Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria, the body acts as the   bedrock of this category of person. The West African pantheon and rituals of   Adja Vodou of? southern Benin and Togo, and southeastern Ghana brought to Haiti,   and the Yoruba religion of southwestern Nigeria brought to Cuba maintain these   fundamental characteristics: the body is the root of religious thought. Both   religions on both sides of the ocean, share that common feature. Fieldwork   material culture will llustrate the lecture.?</p>

    <em>&quot;Enlightening the Plantation System at the Crossroads of the   Second Empire: Bureaucratic Proposals for Agricultural Modernisation,   Diversification, and Free Labour in Spanish Colonial Puerto Rico, c. 1846-1852 &quot; </em></strong></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">As a result of the independence struggles in Central and   South America, by the late 1820s Puerto Rico and Cuba became Spain&rsquo;s sole   colonies in the Americas. From this point forward, metropolitan attention   focused on the Spanish Antilles, whose agricultural economies became tightly   tied to agro-industrial development and trade in the peninsula, contributing to   the emergence of what has come to be known as Spain&rsquo;s Second Empire.? The mass   production of sugar exports by an agricultural sector largely dominated by   slave-based plantations was at the forefront of the agrarian boom that both   islands experienced during this period. By the 1840s, however, domestic and   international forces, such as ecological pressures, fluctuations in the price of   tropical commodities, and the abolition of the slave trade, threatened to   destabilize the agro-exporting colony.? This paper examines a series of   enlightened proposals initiated by the Iberian colonial bureaucracy to reform   Puerto Rican agriculture and labour in order to stave off what some of its   spokespersons believed were the major shortfalls of the slave-based plantation   system.</span></p>

    Suite Justice: A Jazz Setting of the Beatitudes </em></strong></p>
  <p align="left">There are two major steps that serve to move a musical composition   from conception to full realization in a performance. The first step is   multifaceted and includes the development of a melodic idea based on a given   text, realization of the harmonic implications of the melodic idea and   application of an appropriate rhythmic accompaniment.? Also, use of various   compositional devices and arranging techniques serve to balance and blend the   selected forces in such a way as to provide an effective, artistic presentation   of the musical idea.? The composer&rsquo;s dependence on musicians to perform the work   makes up the second step in this process and includes the rehearsal that enables   the performers to conceptualize the composer&rsquo;s intent, the reality of the   logistics involved in bringing together two groups of musicians - the chorus and   the jazz big band - who typically do not perform together, and selection of the   appropriate venue.?</p>

  <p align="left">Both in interviews and in his novel, Junot D?az has tried to   distinguish his representation of the Dominican Republic under Trujillo&rsquo;s regime   from the latest, and highly acclaimed, novel on the topic, Mario Vargas Llosa&rsquo;s <em>La fiesta del chivo. </em>D?az objects to Vargas Llosa&rsquo;s somewhat simplistic   ?in D?az&rsquo;s view-- portrayal of Trujillo, and to his seemingly sympathetic   presentation of Trujillo's successor, Joaqu?n Balaguer. I am interested in the   strategies D?az uses in order to attempt his own representation of the   complexities of Trujillo&rsquo;s power, as he focuses on the way authoritarian power   is diffused and internalized throughout the whole of society. D?az, I argue,   confronts then his own dilemma: how to deconstruct Trujillo, thereby revealing   that power operates in complex ways that go well beyond the actions of one   individual, without trivializing the specificity of Trujillo&rsquo;s tyranny by making   it synonymous with all or any abuse of power.?</p>

    <em>&quot;The Role of the Conductor: A Creative Artist or a mere   Interpreter&quot; </em></strong></p>
  <p>Igor Stravinsky, in his &ldquo;Poetics of Music&rdquo; speaks of the difference between   execution and interpretation of a musical work. He points out that &ldquo;it is   necessary to distinguish two moments, or rather two states of music: potential   music and actual music.&rdquo;? Music is notated by the composer who uses symbols and   various performance directions. Music is to a certain degree limited by its   notation. By comparison, a dramatic actor has much more flexibility regarding   the timing, inflection and manner of delivering of his or her text. The   distinguished conductor Bruno Walter believed that a faithful reproduction of a   work must include a realization of the feelings and mental images that inspired   the composer to write a particular work. This approach was and is shared by many   musical performers. However, there is a danger that a conductor may go too far   and impose his or her own feelings and ideas on the music, thus distorting the   true intent of the composer. Igor Stravinsky acknowledges that? &ldquo;no matter how   scrupulously a piece of music may be notated...it always contains hidden   elements that defy definition&rdquo;.? Stravinsky then states that as a composer he   &ldquo;has the right to seek from the interpreter, in addition to the perfection of   his translation into sound, a loving care- which does not mean, be it   surreptitious or openly affirmed, a recomposition.&rdquo;? The presentation will   discuss examples of performances that seek to interpret symphonic works and the   degree to which they succeed at presenting the composer&rsquo;s work faithfully and   with &ldquo;loving care.</p>

  <p align="left">The representation of trauma and the self has been represented in   the work of many humanists. In the 20th century these representations reflected   the dominant theories of psychiatry based on a special mechanisms view of memory   and the self. My focus is on PTSD, a complex disorder that currently has strict   diagnostic criteria based on a special mechanisms theory. This theory claims   that PTSD involves some unusual operation of memory, stressing a lack of   integration of event representations and the self. The basic systems view   hypothesizes that PTSD actually follows a pattern consistent with the normal   mechanisms of memory and the self. In support of this view, we find that a   strong integration of trauma events into identity is associated with the   development of PTSD symptoms.? If humanists have tied their work to the   sciences, what happens when the science change? </p>

How did these predominantly male   construction workers understand their vulnerability? This presentation draws   from ethnographic research in New Orleans to discuss the ways recently-arrived   Latino workers understood their role in the labor market. It argues that Latino   workers defined a collective experience of courage and determination, which tied   their work-related vulnerabilities to a sense of dignity. More specifically,   this talk looks at how Latinos working in construction manipulated their sense   of who they were as a group in order to stabilize otherwise precarious work   opportunities, arrangements, and conditions following their recent migration and   work within a post-disaster context.</span></p>

African American   women fought back by testifying about their brutal assaults in churches,   courtrooms and congressional hearings. Their refusal to remain silent helped   mobilize community organizations in defense of black womanhood and spurred   larger campaigns for human rights in Southern movement centers like Alabama,   Florida, Mississippi and North Carolina.</p>

While such synergies may hold promise   in a variety of settings, both domestic and international, this examination uses   the lens of community development practice in U.S. cities to ask two questions:   Can adding community health programming to community development practice   enhance community development outcomes? and If so, what are the most promising   program development opportunities? It is based on a scan of cutting-edge   examples in which community development corporations (CDCs) in Boston and   Chicago (two cities long known as innovators in the field) have begun to add a   wide variety of health-related efforts to their programming. Field research   identified collaborations between health and community development institutions   in pursuit of eight types of goals; two of these are highlighted as especially   promising in view of the constraints facing CDCs at the present time. </p>
