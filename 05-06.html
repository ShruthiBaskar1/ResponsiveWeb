  <p align="justify"><em><strong><em><a name="1" id="1"></a></em></strong></em><strong>Sergio   Rivera Ayala</strong>, <strong></strong><em><strong><em>&quot;</em>Race and Power in   XVII Century Colonial Mexico&quot;</strong><br />
  </em>1692 was a devastating year for   the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Floods and heavy rains destroyed most of the wheat   crops which were an important food source for the Spanish population in Mexico.   This natural disaster caused an agricultural crisis and consequently severe food   shortages. In response to the scarcity of food, the colonial authorities   diverted corn stocks, an important food source for the popular classes,   especially the Indian population, to the rest of colonial society. This choice   of policy, instead of solving the crisis, aggravated it even more, generating an   increase in grain prices and a shortage of food. Some government officials were   implicated in the elevated prices and shortages. As a result, the popular   classes revolted in Mexico City, center of the Spanish colonial empire.   Plebeians took control of the Vice regal palace and burned it, clamoring &ldquo;death   to the gachupines&rdquo; (derogatory expression for Spaniards). Carlos de Sig?enza y   G?ngora, a prominent Creole, (American-born Spaniard) wrote a report on the   riots. He was well known for his passion for indigenous history and culture. The   author appropriated and incorporated elements of the native in his writing and   these became part of the emerging Creole identity and a foundational part of   Creole ethos. Because the Spanish-born &ldquo;gachupines&rdquo; from all walks of life   believed themselves superior to Creoles, their American-born counterparts, in   reaction, showed pride in things native to Mexico. Sig?enza y G?ngora not only   spoke Nahuatl, the main indigenous language of Central Mexico, but his personal   library contained a great number of indigenous codices. It was one of the best   libraries of the Americas. However the position he took in his report about the   1692 riots is very problematic. He blamed the Indians for the entire emergency   and absolved the colonial authorities, praising them instead for all the efforts   they made to control the crisis. Creoles like Sig?enza y G?ngora perceived this   revolt, which had more characteristics of a spontaneous event resulting from the   accumulated anger and unjust situation endured by the lower classes, as an   example of the behavior of the &ldquo;treacherous Indians&rdquo;. What made Sig?enza y   G?ngora take a position in defense of the colonial powers and condemn the   indigenous population? How can we read his position in the text in relation with   the antagonism between Creole and gachupines? What kind of challenge did the   voice of the indigenous population present in the Creole&rsquo;s mind? The purpose of   this talk is to explore Creole identity and its relationship with the power of   the colonial state as well as other ethnicities.</p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="2" id="2"></a><strong>John Corvino</strong>, <strong><em>&quot;How   to Be a Humean Moral Realist&quot;</em></strong><br />
    Moral realists hold that there   are moral truths that are (to some extent) independent of our beliefs about   them: our moral beliefs should answer to these truths, and not the other way   around. Anti-realists, by contrast, see moral truths as a (largely malleable)   human construct wherein we project our feelings out onto the world. Although   moral realism is attractive for its attempt to provide objective moral   standards, realists often have a hard time explaining both the source and the   normative authority of such standards.</p>
  <p align="justify">The eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher David Hume, whose   moral theory is based on human sentiment, is often claimed as an ally of the   anti-realists. In this paper I defend a somewhat controversial realist (or at   least quasi-realist) reading of Hume. I argue that Hume's sentimentalism is a   promising route for providing objective standards while avoiding some of the   familiar pitfalls of realism.</p>

  </em></strong>Machado de Assis and Lima Barreto are major Brazilian   writers, of African ancestry, who lived and worked at the end of the nineteenth   and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, through the period of the   abolition of slavery and its aftermath. Though they are both counted as   realists, their approach to the social, political, and economic circumstances   around them?including the fate and position of Brazilians of African   ancestry?marks the range of possibilities within the scope of realism and fuels   a lasting controversy about the responsibility of the writer toward his   environment and about the implications of different styles of approaching this   environment. As I trace the careers and reception of Assis and Barreto, brief   references to African (North) American literature will illustrate, by contrast,   the different possible relations between text and context, text and   reception.</p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="4" id="4"></a><strong>David Moxley and Olivia Washington, <em>&ldquo;Narratives of Recovery: How Older African American Women Emerge from   Homelessness&rdquo;<br />
  </em></strong>The experience of homelessness is situated in a   very complex social location, which justifies multiple approaches to   representation. The Telling My Story Project experiments with developing and   using these multiple representations in partnership with formerly homeless older   minority women who act as guides to the investigators, and as mentors helping   them construct richer insights into the tragedy of homelessness and the triumph   of emerging out of it. While homelessness is arduous for anyone, it is   particularly difficult for older minority women, for a variety of reasons. But   the representations the women produce indicate that they are not victims but   authors of their own experience in which strengths, resilience, being and   becoming interact to make them active, purposeful, and deliberate in their   efforts to emerge out of homelessness and leave it behind.</p>
  <p align="justify">The presenters will examine several narratives of homelessness   they obtained through in-depth and intensive interviews of eight older African   American women who emerged from homelessness successfully but who still face   numerous issues and threats that can induce setbacks. The emergence process was   not easy and, in some cases took a considerable toll on mental and physical   health. The presenters will examine the themes of recovery and emergence   imbedded within each story and they will offer frameworks that capture the   process two women negotiated. These frameworks illuminate the deficiencies in   contemporary communities, and the weaknesses in the safety net of social   welfare. In addition, the narratives reveal a stark reality: even though the   women achieve some success they face numerous challenges to recovery, to staying   out of homelessness, and to gaining the resources they need to achieve   independent living and some semblance of stability.</p>

  <p align="justify"><a name="5" id="5"></a><strong>Joe Calarco</strong>, <strong></strong><em><strong>&quot;The Modern Poet as Mage and Musician: From W. B.   Yeats to Dylan Thomas and Beyond&quot;</strong></em><br />
    It is hardly surprising that   the first volume of R.F. Foster&rsquo;s recent monumental W. B. Yeats: A Life is   subtitled The Apprentice Mage. Almost from the beginning, Yeats&rsquo; poetic   enterprise is a departure from naturalism and an effort to transform the natural   world and man himself in the image of a magical, transcendent order. In one of   his poems, The Song of Wandering Aengus, the wanderer and his finally-achieved   beloved will &ldquo;pluck till time and times are done/ The silver apples of the   moon,/ The golden apples of the sun.&rdquo; It is only a step from this vision to the   later Byzantium of Yeat&rsquo;s imagination, where he aspires to the artifice of a   golden bird upon a golden bough, singing &ldquo;to lords and ladies of Byzantium/ Of   what is past, or passing, or to come.&rdquo;<br />
    <br />
    When Yeats performed his poems, it   was in a sonorous, elevated style unpopular with his harsher critics. It was not   until the American tours of Dylan Thomas that such a style was to be   immortalized. For both poets, there are impermeable chains binding the sound and   sense of a poem. To speak of them being &ldquo;read&rdquo; or &ldquo;spoken&rdquo; seems an insult to   the experience of a performance; say instead that they are sung, though not in   the conventions of the diatonic system; or say that they are chanted, like the   spells Yeats actually cast as a mage of the Order of the Golden Dawn.</p>
  <p align="justify">It is remarkable that these Yeats poems, so antique in some of   their references, resonate so profoundly in a world caught in the war of   cultures. Or that the poems of Thomas, so obscure in some of their references   and metaphors, dance on the tympanum in a place beyond sense but not beyond   passion.</p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="6" id="6"></a><strong>Ken Jackson</strong>, <strong></strong><em><strong>&quot;Is it God or the Sovereign Exception?: Giorgio   Agamben and Shakespeare&rsquo;s King John&quot;</strong></em><br />
    Shakespeare&rsquo;s infrequently   staged (and read) King John opens with the familiar problem of the history   plays: a disputed claim to the throne. The play stands out in how quickly and   directly it addresses the problem of sovereign legitimacy. The French Ambassador   about to challenge John&rsquo;s kingship in favor of John&rsquo;s young nephew, Arthur,   refers to John&rsquo;s position as &ldquo;borrowed majesty&rdquo; in the fourth line. This   insinuation immediately elicits an irritated reaction from Eleanor, John&rsquo;s   strong willed mother: &ldquo;A strange beginning: &lsquo;borrowed majesty&rsquo;&rdquo; (1.1.5). But the   scene quickly reveals that even Eleanor has some doubts about King John&rsquo;s   legitimacy. While John believes his &ldquo;strong possession&rdquo; and &ldquo;right&rdquo; argue for   him, his mother secretly cautions that &ldquo;Your strong possession much more than   your right,/ Or else it must go wrong with you and me (1.1.40-41). The   implication is clear. John has &ldquo;strong possession&rdquo; certainly, and perhaps some   right (&ldquo;more than your right&rdquo;), but certainly not absolute right. As King Philip   of France points out to King John, &ldquo;Geoffrey was [John&rsquo;s] elder brother born&rdquo;   and therefore Geoffrey&rsquo;s young son, Arthur, rightfully claims the throne   (2.1.104). Indeed, Shakespeare puzzles throughout the play, if Arthur&rsquo;s claim is   right, how can a king find himself on a sacred throne without divine authority?   For the modern audience, of course, the answer is simple. Divinely determined   authority is a myth or, to borrow Montaigne&rsquo;s phrase, a &ldquo;mystical foundation&rdquo;   for authority. &ldquo;Strong possession&rdquo; or violence alone determines sovereignty.   But, lo and behold, that steely-eyed, secular, modern perspective has not   stopped us one bit from conjuring other equally mystical foundations for   authority to distinguish the legitimacy of one violent sovereign from another.   Giorgio Agamben insists, for example, that our various modern declarations of   the rights of man ? our respect for the &ldquo;sacredness&rdquo; of bare life (homo sacer) ?   now grounds a state&rsquo;s legitimacy and sovereignty. This essay attempt to use   Shakespeare&rsquo;s King John, and its stunning treatment of Arthur in particular, to   illuminate the tenacious connections Agamben displays between the &ldquo;religious&rdquo;   desire for a divinely determined sovereign, and our &ldquo;secular&rdquo; desire for a just   and legitimate government.</p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="7" id="7"></a><strong>Haiyong Liu</strong>, <strong><em>&quot;The   Initial Stage and Parameter-resetting in Second Language Acquisition of   Chinese&quot;<br />
  </em></strong>According to the Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis   (Schwartz and Sprouse, 1996), both first language and universal grammar play a   role in second language acquisition, the former as the initial stage and the   latter triggering parameter-resetting through learning. My experiments show that   language learners, in addition to language transfer from their native language,   also have access to universal grammar at the initial stage. For example,   although English reflexives allow only local antecedents, as can been that   himself can only refer to Tom in 'John says that Tom likes himself', English   speakers learning Chinese do show signs of the awareness of the possible   long-distance antecedents that are possible in Chinese; i.e. himself in 'John   says that Tom likes himself ' refers to either John or Tom. On the other hand,   English speakers tend to allow both subjects and objects as antecedents for   Chinese reflexives in their learning, a transfer from their native English, as   can be seen from the ambiguity of himself in 'John gives Tom a picture of   himself', when Chinese allows only subject antecedents. Similar asymmetry can be   seen from the acquisition the pro-drop (optional-subject parameter) of Chinese,   which is not allowed in English. I conclude that it is harder for a speaker   speaking a language with a certain marked (less common) feature to acquire a   feature in a foreign language that is unmarked (more common), but not the other   way around. </p>

    The city of   Detroit has become emblematic of digital culture. Even the idea of a &ldquo;Digital   Detroit&rdquo; has become the topic and title of an annual city-based conference.   Calling the city &ldquo;digital,&rdquo; though, evokes a significant question: Whereas   Industrial Detroit produced an assembly line logic of equal parts in the system,   uniformed structure, and concentration of work and knowledge in one space, how   does Digital Detroit lead to a new media logic? This talk will explore the   notion of Digital Detroit, but it will not do so in terms of instrumental   reasoning. By that, I mean the concept of a Digital Detroit does not depend on   software, hardware, financial investment, or any other &ldquo;grand narrative&rdquo; of   recovery Detroit embraces and most of us recognize as familiar. Instead, this   talk will explore Digital Detroit in terms of new media logic and rhetorical   production. How do Detroit&rsquo;s empty spaces contribute to - as well as generate -   a new media logic of speculation, conjecture, juxtaposition, appropriation, and   assemblage? How has assembly line thinking yielded to assemblage thinking?</p>

  <p align="justify"><strong><a name="10" id="10"></a>Bob Sedler</strong>, <strong><em>&quot;Freedom of Speech: United States vs. The Rest of the   World&quot;<br />
  </em></strong>The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the   First Amendment&rsquo;s guarantee of freedom of speech very expansively, and the   constitutional protection afforded to freedom of speech is perhaps the strongest   protection afforded to any individual right under the Constitution. It is also   fair to say that the constitutional protection afforded to freedom of speech in   the United States is seemingly unparalleled anywhere else in the world, and that   in the United States, as a constitutional matter, the value of freedom of speech   generally prevails over other democratic values, such as equality and privacy.   For this reason, the American view of freedom of speech is not always consistent   with international human rights norms and the protection of freedom of speech in   other democratic countries. These norms and the constitutional law of other   democratic countries treat freedom of speech as an important right, but one that   must be balanced against other democratic rights.</p>
  <p align="justify">Professor Sedler explains why it is that the American   Constitution provides so much protection to freedom of speech. He maintains that   this is because in our constitutional system, constitutional law develops on a   case-by-case basis through the process of constitutional litigation. As the   Court has decided First Amendment cases over the years, it has promulgated   concepts, principles and doctrines and has established precedents. The sum total   of these concepts, principles, doctrines and precedents comprise what he calls   the &ldquo;law of the First Amendment,&rdquo; which provides a great deal of protection to   freedom of speech. For this reason, in actual First Amendment litigation, there   is a very good likelihood that the First Amendment claim will prevail.</p>
  <p align="justify">Nowhere is the difference between the constitutional protection   of freedom of speech in the United States and the rest of the world more   apparent than with respect to laws prohibiting &ldquo;hate speech.&rdquo; Most other   democratic nations, including Canada, the neighbor to our north, and   international human rights documents, such as the International Covenant on   Civil Rights, prohibit the expression of &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; and take the position   that &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; is not a part of the guarantee of freedom of speech. Thus,   the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits the &ldquo;advocacy   of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to   discrimination, hostility or violence.&rdquo; In contrast, when the United States   Supreme Court was faced with constitutional challenges to laws that prohibited   &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; or &ldquo;incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence,&rdquo; the   Court applied two principles that had emerged from its First Amendment cases   over the years. Under the principle of protection of offensive speech, the   government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society   itself finds the idea offensive or disagreeable. Under the principle of content   neutrality, the government may not prohibit any speech because of its content or   the message it conveys. Following the Court&rsquo;s application of these principles,   it was clear that &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; laws were unconstitutional.</p>
  <p align="justify">Much of the strong protection that the Court has afforded to   freedom of speech results from the Court&rsquo;s application of the content neutrality   principle. The underlying premise of this principle is that the First Amendment   establishes a marketplace of ideas, that all ideas, good and bad, must be able   to compete in this marketplace, and that the remedy for bad speech is more   speech, not enforced silence. It is this underlying premise that is subject to   strong attack by critics of the Court&rsquo;s current First Amendment jurisprudence,   and that it rejected by other democratic countries and by international human   rights norms. The critics insist that there are bad ideas, like genocide, and   racism, and sexism, and homophobia, that find their way into the marketplace,   and maintain that the government should be able to prohibit the expression of   bad ideas because of the harm that they cause to society and to &ldquo;victim groups.&rdquo;   It is this view that is reflected in the constitutional law of other democratic   nations and international human rights norms.</p>
  <p align="justify">Professor Sedler proposes that this colloquium explore the   greater constitutional protection provided to freedom of speech in the United   States, in comparison to the rest of the world, in light of humanistic values.   Can humanistic values provide guidance as to how strongly we should protect   freedom of speech when it takes the form of &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; and of what most of us   would consider to be &ldquo;bad ideas&rdquo;? Can humanistic values be relied on to support   strong constitutional protection to freedom of speech?</p>

The even better news is that you&rsquo;ll pay   significantly less than you would have before the arrival of Internet   booksellers. Bob Holley will report on his research that used a sample of   advertisements to buy and to sell out-of-print books from the pre-Internet days   (1982 and 1992). A high percentage of the items (75%+) were in the Humanities.   Using the meta-search engine, used.addall.com, he discovered 95% availability in   all four samples. In inflation adjusted dollars, prices had dropped around 45%   from pre-Internet days. He attributes the changes to the efficiencies of large   databases and the ability of the Internet to match buyers and sellers. Scholars   and libraries now have much better chance of finding older books.</p>

Molly evolved through the   following political stages: student New Leftist (at Wayne State University in   1968), socialist feminist, Maoist-communist for seven years, and for the past 30   years, a seamstress and militant union organizer with UNITE HERE in Southern   textile factories.</p>

Much of   what we know about aggression in healthcare and other organizational settings is   based on cross-sectional survey data?which tells us little about the underlying   dynamics within specific aggressive incidents. Describing the connections and   sequencing of behaviors within an incident in detail allows us to articulate the   various pathways an incident can take and their resultant outcomes (constructive   or destructive).

In this presentation, which is based on   preliminary data from this ongoing project, I will focus on causal attributions   for the incident as perceived by the interviewees and explore how differences in   attribution by parties to the event link to subsequent responding and hence the   escalation or de-escalation of the incident.</p>

  </em></strong>I will talk about three sorts of relativism: about   truth, about justification, and about morality. Some claim that there are no   truths, but this view is self-defeating. If it is true, then there is at least   one truth, and so it is false. Others claim that to say that something is true   is just short for saying that it is true for some person, culture, epoch, or the   like. I will argue that the &ldquo;true for S&rdquo; locution just means &ldquo;believed true by   S,&rdquo; and so is uninteresting.</p>
  <p align="justify">When it comes to justification, some claim that we are not   justified in believing anything. This claim, like its counterpart denying truth,   is self-defeating. If we are justified in believing it, then it is false, for   then we would be justified in believing something. A slightly more interesting   claim is that evidence is subjective: what is evidence for you need not be   evidence for me. An even more interesting claim denies the following: if two   people have exactly the same evidence for some proposition, then one of those   persons is justified in believing that proposition if, and only if, the other   is. I will also argue against the slightly more interesting claim, and the   denial of the much more interesting, claim. Justification is relative to   evidence, but evidence is not subjective Evidence requires that everyone who   possesses it, and only it, take just one of three possible epistemic stances   toward the relevant proposition: believe it, suspend judgment, disbelieve   it.</p>
  <p align="justify">Finally, some people think that morality is relative in the   sense that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a matter of opinion&rdquo; whether some action is right or wrong   and whether some types of person are good or bad. However, this seems obviously   false. It is wrong to torture innocent children to death just for the fun of it;   it is wrong to enslave people; it is wrong to rape someone; and it is wrong to   deny someone her liberty if she poses no danger to herself or others, and has   not committed any crimes. Also, rapists and hitmen are bad people. That we do   not know the moral status of all types of actions and people does not mean that   we do not know the moral status of some of them. Moral relativism is false   because we do, and so morality is not &ldquo;just a matter of opinion.&rdquo;</p>

  </em></strong>There has been much popular   discussion, in recent years, of a two-brain basis for human intelligence: a   left-brain and a right-brain, one responsible for analytical behavior, the other   for holistic and language activity. I am in no position to comment on the   usefulness or validity of this basis set. But, as a result of many years of   teaching physics and astronomy at the introductory college levels, I am   convinced of an alternative two-brain basis for student behavior: an &quot;in-school   brain&quot;, and an &quot;out-of-school life brain&quot;, with very little, if any, connection   between the two.</p>
  <p align="justify">Too often we physicists teach science as if the two components   of this orthogonal basis set did not exist. We teach to one axis and ignore the   strong transition to the other, which occurs soon after the student leaves our   classrooms. As a result, our own academic &quot;turf&quot; is increasingly under attack as   a growing fraction of our population, many college-educated, urge the   substitution of religion for science in our schools and public life.   Consequently, ignoring the appropriate sciences, our society pays a heavy price:   decaying cities; snail's space transportation systems: air, water and land which   are challenges to our health rather than supports for our well-being; and,   increasingly, competition, and even battle, over shrinking resources and space.   Hence it would be useful to have some clear notions as to where, if any, there   are necessary conflicts between religion and science, and where they may   coexist.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>

  </em></strong>Women&rsquo;s Studies programs have grown out of a range   of feminist perspectives. Liberal feminist beliefs have influenced many programs   to focus on women&rsquo;s voices on the assumption that those voices, once heard,   would be accorded value that would in turn facilitate inclusion and rights in   established institutions. Another assumption grounding Women&rsquo;s Studies programs,   growing out of cultural or relational feminism, was that women&rsquo;s unique values   could usefully inform and potentially transform the many fields in which their   voices would speak. In keeping with such assumptions, Wayne State&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s   Studies co-majors and minors pair a disciplinary major with a focus on issues of   gender or sexuality so that they may both participate in and potentially alter   fields of endeavor traditionally unavailable to them.</p>

  </em></strong>Constitutionalism   is usually understood as the practice of entrenching certain norms, including   norms of individual rights, so that current political majorities cannot easily   reject or change them. But people of good faith inevitably disagree about the   rights they and others have. Some constitutional theorists, most recently Jeremy   Waldron, have argued that the inevitability of disagreement about rights makes   problematic the idea of constitutional rights, particularly judicially enforced   constitutional rights. Waldron contends that the only fair way to resolve   political disagreements, including disagreements about rights, is through a   democratic process of full and fair participation by contemporary citizens, not   by an elite cadre of unelected judges interpreting centuries-old text.</p>
  <p align="justify">I&rsquo;ll argue, <em>contra</em> Waldron, that the fact of   persistent disagreement supports rather than undermines the case for   constitutional rights. The key, I&rsquo;ll contend, is to understand constitutional   law as a process of acceptable dispute resolution rather than a set of   entrenched norms. A political community might reasonably choose to resolve its   disputes <em>about</em> democratic participation by means <em>other</em> than   democratic participation. More broadly, a community might choose to resolve its   disputes about <em>political justice</em> ? about the community&rsquo;s authority to   impose its moral views upon dissenters ? through procedures that are relatively   impartial with respect to those moral views. A constitution, interpreted by an   independent judiciary, can resolve questions about rights through procedures   that are meaningfully external to everyday democracy and its moral and political   controversies; those resolutions then might be generally acceptable in a way the   products of ordinary politics could not be.</p>

    In   early modern French society, common and royal law were meant to shape   inheritance practice in order to respond to the social needs of families and   communities. For example, in certain regions of France primogeniture governed   the logic of distributing wealth after a father&rsquo;s death and eldest sons assumed   ownership of family property leaving their siblings with very little to claim   from the natal family. Elsewhere all children, male and female, shared in their   family&rsquo;s wealth at the death of their parents. Families and individuals also   used mechanisms like loans, annuities, and life-use clauses in various contracts   to channel wealth to favored heirs even when such actions betrayed the intent of   legal customs. One of the most common ways families skirted the intentions of   the law was to specify widows&rsquo; rights to use family property after their   husbands&rsquo; deaths, even when such clauses prevented rightful heirs from claiming   their property. This paper will explore ways in which families used contracts to   manipulate the transfer of property in ways that did not conform to law in order   to assert the primacy of their own interests above those of the kingdom&rsquo;s legal   system. </p>

    There has been a recent   upsurge in television and film narratives that focus on the documentation of   people&rsquo;s identity. Historically, an identity card--usually issued by an agency   of a particular nation-state--serves as proof of one's identity and   simultaneously grants rights and protection under the legal system of the state.   Films such as <em>Minority Report</em>, <em>Code 46</em>, and <em>Dirty Pretty   Things</em>, imagine the body as its own identity card. These narratives often   serve as a warning of the ways in which our lives are rapidly changing.   Fingerprints and eye-scans instantly provide information about a person&rsquo;s DNA,   bank accounts, criminal activities, and so forth. Though <em>Minority   Report</em> and <em>Code 46</em> are set in the future, bodily methods of   documentation are either already in operation or well on their way towards   implementation.

  <p align="justify"><strong><a name="27" id="27"></a>Arthur Marotti, <em>&ldquo;The Personal   Anthologizing of Poetry in Manuscript in Early Modern   England&rdquo;<br />
  </em></strong>In sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England the   manuscript system of literary transmission continued to thrive, despite the   growing importance of print as a medium for the publication of poetry. Within   manuscript culture, particular individuals, in a practice resembling the habit   of &ldquo;commonplacing&rdquo; or the keeping of commonplace books of valued information and   quotations, sometimes assembled personal anthologies of verse. Participating in   a system of literary transmission that allowed compilers and scribes to alter,   supplement, and answer the poems they collected, as well as to add their own   compositions to the collections, these anthologists, within particular social   environments (such as the university, the Inns-of-Court, the royal court, and   aristocratic households), left to us a large number of poetical anthologies that   represent a wider field of writing than that usually covered by traditional   literary history, which has been based mainly on the products of print culture.   This paper will consider some of the larger cultural-historical and literary   issues involved in this practice and use as examples three different manuscript   collections from the period. Finally, it will offer a series of reasons why it   is important to study these documents and others to be found in the archives   that preserve them. </p>

  </em></strong>As a designation of certain academic disciplines,   the adjective &lsquo;applied&rsquo; (&lsquo;applied linguistics, physics&rsquo; etc.) often carries   negative connotations which are not part of the semantics of the word in other   domains, nor in the original sense. Used as a prefix, it is frequently   interpreted as implying a lack of intellectual rigor with, often, a definite   connotation of inferiority compared to the &lsquo;pure&rsquo;, theoretical study it is   related to. However, what may be labeled &lsquo;applied&rsquo; varies both within and across   areas of scholarship. Within the language sciences some aspects of linguistics,   like the study of second language acquisition, are probably considered &lsquo;applied&rsquo;   by the majority of linguists, while other endeavors are less clearly categorized   (is language planning 'applied linguistics'?) and still others are very   occasionally thus designated (historical linguistics as an applied field, for   example). The directionality in the development of the field (from &lsquo;pure&rsquo; to   &lsquo;applied&rsquo; or vice versa) may be an issue too; there are what might be called   markedness reversals in disciplines which start as completely applied (language   teaching itself, for example) which then develop a &ldquo;purer&rdquo; side through an   increased emphasis on theory and research.</p>
  <p align="justify">This paper is an exploration, both synchronic and diachronic,   of the meaning of &lsquo;applied&rsquo; in an academic setting, particularly as it appears   in Linguistics. The paper is couched in the framework of Cognitive Semantics. We   use both the notion of the radial set and the tool of scalarity in discussing   this meaningful unit which, even within the domain of universities, is   polysemous semantically or at least pragmatically. With various functions of the   prefix come varying connotations within different disciplines and   subdisciplines, hence the advantage of looking at a prototype configuration as   well as the location of any given use along a continuum of positive and negative   value judgments. The differences in directionality and in location on the   continuum constitute alternative construals, depending on discipline-specific   central points or prototypes.</p>

  <p align="justify">The humor in the cartoon above turns on the use of several   utterances that consist of a single phrase. Traditionally, utterances like these   have been called fragments, thought to derive by ellipsis from full sentence   sources within the discourse. In our work, we argue that such phrases are   actually derived directly, rather than via a sentential source, and thus we call   them nonsententials. Our central claim is that the universal human grammar   generates not only sentences but also nonsententials ? directly derived Noun   Phrases, Verb Phrases, Adjective Phrases, Adverb Phrases, Prepositional Phrases,   and small clauses (e.g., Me first, Him worry?) ? with propositional content.   Using the current linguistic theory of Minimalism, we argue that speakers have   access to both a sentential and a nonsentential grammar, and that the   nonsentential grammar is the basis for the use of independent phrases and small   clauses in conversation, in first and second language acquisition, in special   registers (e.g., recipes, headlines), and in processes of pidginization and   creolization. We are editing a volume (forthcoming from John Benjamins) that   brings together researchers from syntax, semantics, philosophy of language,   language acquisition, agrammatism/aphasia, and pidgin and creole studies to   describe the structure and interpretation of nonsententials in a variety of   languages and contexts. In this Brown Bag presentation, we will present   cross-linguistic data from a variety of chapters in the volume that support and   extend this argument.</p>

The literary and aesthetic are nevertheless   important to the thinking of Habermas, who has had a significant impact on   literary theory, first with his innovative concept of the public sphere, a   conceptual breakthrough that has been enormously productive in the humanities   and social sciences. He has also played a productive role in theoretical   discussions of the Enlightenment, post-structuralism, and postmodernism,   debating the ideas of Foucault and Derrida, and becoming the defender of   modernity in the postmodernism debate with Lyotard.

Black congregations remain less likely   than white congregations to provide emergency (e.g. food, clothing and cash   assistance) programs even when both congregations have an equal resource   capacity. This likely suggest that black congregational bodies are less willing   than are their white counterparts to provide programs that seemingly provide a   short-term fix for human needs. To the contrary, black congregations place   greater priority on educational programs than do white congregations. This   finding may serve as an indicator of the greater willingness of black   congregations to invest resources in programs that have more of a long-term   impact. Both black and white congregations, however, invest a similar amount of   resources into housing-related programs.

James's   historical-political interpretation, The Black Jacobins. Although both of these   works are considered classical Caribbean approaches to the events in Haiti,   their approaches are dramatically different. Specifically, Carpentier's novel   foregrounds the religious dimensions of the revolution, and a careful reading of   the text shows how all of the important events of the Revolution are in fact   linked to, and &quot;explained&quot; in terms of, the cosmogonical powers of Haitian   Voodoo. James, on the other hand, while acknowledging the role of voodoo in the   Revolution, is more interested in the use that the rebellious slaves make of the   &quot;enlightened&quot; ideas and movements of the French Revolution. I suggest that,   besides differences of genre and personal inclination, the differences between   Carpentier and James are better explained by the fact that neither of them is   writing only, or even mainly, about Haiti, but rather using Haiti as an emblem   or illustration of other political and cultural struggles. </p>

  </em></strong>While historically, hip-hop's socio-political   significance is undeniable, the genre is often relegated to &quot;booty music&quot;, which   dilutes the organic messages that have challenged the status quo and served as a   part of hip-hop's history since its inception in the late 1960s/early 1970s.   Today, rap music leads as the primary defining element of hip-hop culture and   drives its marketability. This marketability is seen through music videos,   partnerships between corporate entities and hip-hop artists like Nelly and Snoop   Dog, and sales of hip-hop music and fashion across cultural and geographic   boundaries. This begs the question &ldquo;Is hip-hop&rsquo;s commodification a sign of the   continued selling and &lsquo;pimping&rsquo; of Black culture to the masses?&rdquo;, or, as hip-hop   critic Greg Tate writes, is it &ldquo;an African American response to the   consumerization and disposability of people&rdquo; (Tate, 1999, p. 386).</p>
  <p align="justify">Hip-hop culture has been described as the most explosive,   engaging, and controversial form of (black) American pop culture to find global   circulation and acclaim in the last quarter century (Dyson, 2004) and arguably   so. Deemed as a passing fad, the music of hip-hop has permeated not just   American culture, but has touched the lives of individuals all over the world.   But are the images and messages projected through this genre hegemonic and   ultimately self-destructive to the African American community?</p>
  <p align="justify">During this talk, I will argue that the hip-hop phenomenon in   American culture, specifically the music that delivers its message, is worthy of   a more critical examination. It is important to explore the key messages and   images that are shared and understood by members of the hip-hop culture and the   implications these messages and images have on the formation and maintenance of   cultural identity.</p>
  <p align="justify">Hip-Hop music is no longer limited to the ghetto poor, but its   major themes and styles continue to be drawn from the conflicts and   contradictions of black urban life. Through an analysis of music videos, we will   explore these conflicts and contradictions in hip-hop&rsquo;s key messages and discuss   major images, particularly of African American women that are represented in   music videos and artists lyrics.</p>

  </em></em></strong>Too often the history of the Caribbean, as   can be the case of other regions, is written from a narrow local perspective.   When approached from this angle, the specific historical trajectories of   individual island-nations or countries tend to emphasize internal developments   considered noteworthy of their evolution, cultures, and place in the world.

The first section   describes and classifies these policies by issue area, date implemented,   government sponsor, and duration. The educational, housing, health,   informational, cultural, affirmative action and other policies have been   implemented by government agencies at the local, state, and national levels. The   second section argues that recent affirmative action policies should be   conceptualized as a continuation of earlier pro-Black government initiatives and   not a new and completely unprecedented policy program. The third section   proposes a political process model of pro-Black policies that places them in the   context of democratization. The dynamic interaction between opposition Black   political activists and newly elected opposition leaders creates the political   space for the formulation and implementation of these policies. This model   emphasizes the leading roles of Black activists and politicians over those of   White politicians who may have formally approved these policies. The conclusion   examines the prospects for more comprehensive pro-Black policies in Brazil and   other countries in Latin America.</p>

  </em>A Social Worker's   Investigation of Childbirth Injured Women in Northern Nigeria investigates   Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF), a childbirth injury commonly found among younger   adolescent wives in northern Nigeria. Women with fistulae continuously drip   urine. Their offensive odor often leads to life as social outcasts. Millions of   women across Africa and the developing world suffer from this condition, but it   is preventable and curable. This work examines the problem from the perspective   of a social worker. It is not intended as a medical treatise, but instead deals   with the condition from an ecological perspective using a systems approach. Its   focus is on VVF as it relates to the social environment of the affected   women.</p>
  <p align="justify">The author defines and describes VVF as it manifests itself in   Africa, along with the history and epidemiology of the condition and its   treatment. It describes the life course of Hausa women who are most affected by   VVF in northern Nigeria and how their position in society predisposed them to   childbirth injury. Testimonials of the victims about their struggles of survival   and their road to a cure are narrated. Short and long term preventive measures   are given. The empowerment of northern Nigerian women for the eradication of   this condition is a fundamental and underlying theme of this work.

Inspired by African chants, Gregorian chant, American   hymn tunes, the African American Spiritual and &ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; Gospel melodies,   they give voice to the myriad facets of the musical life of Black people.   Hopefully this organ recital with commentary will offer the listener another   perspective of their rich and diverse artistic gifts.</p>

  </em></strong>Seminal choreographers of early American modern   dance each respectively had a unique philosophy and approach to creating their   own movement expression. Modern dance has evolved dramatically since its   inception in the early 1900s, with its strength in individuality and freedom of   expression through movement. Choreographers subscribing to this philosophy   include Denishawn&rsquo;s interpretations of East Asian dances; Martha Graham&rsquo;s   Americana and Greek tragedy themed dances; Merce Cunningham&rsquo;s abstract chance   choreography influenced by Chinese I Ching philosophy and Japanese minimalism;   and Alvin Ailey&rsquo;s soulful blend of African American themed ballets. Present day   choreographers examining the fusion of ethnic forms with modern dance are Mark   Morris and his use of European folk dance themes and ideas; Doug Elkin&rsquo;s   African-American Hip-Hop influenced movement; and Sean Curran&rsquo;s Celtic   choreography. Although each is dissimilar in movement quality, visual design and   intention, the common thread that weaves these choreographers is their strong   individual artistic voice through dance.</p>
  <p align="justify">Philippine folk dances have a long-standing history of   remaining relatively stable in form, structure and presentation that represent   these archipelago islands in the southeast. Dances originating in the most   Islamic region of the country reflect the Hindu-Malayan-Arabic influences. In   Mindanao, these are the Maranao, Magindanao and Sanggil groups. Adding to this   diversity of Philippine dances are the Igorot, Ifugao, Bontoc, Kalinga and   Apayao tribes. These indigenous dance forms together with contemporary modern   dance are another means to explore a unique and innovative choreographic voice.   This lecture-demonstration will present the movement relationships and infusion   of traditional Filipino regional dances with contemporary modern   dance.<strong></strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="43" id="43"></a><strong>Jeffrey Abt, <em>&ldquo;Returns of the   Repressed: Museums and Religion&rdquo;</em></strong><em><br />
  </em>A funny thing   happened to the museum on its way from classical antiquity to modernity: It   evolved from a cult center to a secular institution. However, the worldwide   surge of religious fundamentalism is challenging modernity&rsquo;s secular ethos as   expressed in a host of social structures ranging from governments to school   curricula. The museum too, as one of modernity&rsquo;s more prominent institutional   forms, has become a site where secular systems of learning and display are being   reshaped to accommodate the tenets of religious faith.</p>
  <p align="justify">If, as many have argued, the post-Enlightenment museum   represents the triumph of modernity, it does so by rendering a distinction   between showing religious objects to produce knowledge and showing them for   pious devotion. Beginning as early as the Louvre&rsquo;s formation in the crucible of   the French revolution, this meant neutralizing a sacred object&rsquo;s religious   potency by emphasizing its place in art history. More recently, however, as   museums strive to broaden their public service by inviting potential   constituencies to participate in exhibition planning and collections management,   the uses and interpretation of religious objects have received special scrutiny.   As results stemming from the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and   Repatriation Act or the creation of the American Bible Society&rsquo;s Gallery in 1998   show, sacred objects are posing unforeseen challenges to the museum&rsquo;s function   as a secular site for the production and dissemination of knowledge.</p>
  <p align="justify">This paper surveys the museum&rsquo;s evolution into a secular   institution, its efforts to cultivate various constituencies, and how those   efforts are inadvertently bringing to the surface long-suppressed religious   content in collections, thus provoking a fundamental challenge to the museum&rsquo;s   secular ethos.</p>

  <p align="justify"><a name="45" id="45"></a><strong>Kypros Markou, <em>&ldquo;Nationalism in Music   in a Globalized World&rdquo;<br />
  </em></strong>The term &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo; in music usually   refers to a phase of the romantic movement whereby composers sought inspiration   and material in the folk music, folk art and culture of their home country or   region. Some of the most prominent composers that come to mind are Dvorak,   Smetana, Grieg, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov. It would be a mistake to assume that   their &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo; had political implications or that it was the result of &ldquo;a   rebellion against foreign music.&rdquo; As A. J. B. Hutchings points out in the   Pelican History of Music, Dvorak (who was Czech) regularly sent his scores to   the great German composer Brahms who was his friend and great supporter.   Generally &ldquo;nationalist&rdquo; composers celebrate and represent the spirit, culture   and special characteristics of their people. As a matter of fact there are many   composers who are not classified as &ldquo;nationalists&rdquo; but who also incorporated or   sought inspiration in the folk music and culture of their country. Furthermore,   perceptions about a given composer differ from place to place. A striking   example is the case of Tchaikovsky who in his homeland was not considered to be   writing &ldquo;Russian&rdquo; music whereas everywhere else we think of him as one of the   most important and characteristically &ldquo;Russian&rdquo; composers whose music reflects   the Russian character and soul.</p>
  <p align="justify">Globalization generally refers to the process whereby many   experiences, products, ideas etc. become standardized throughout the world.   While this process may result in certain efficiencies and increased   productivities and perhaps even a certain understanding and bridging of   differences between people of various races and nationalities, it would indeed   be tragic if composers lost their individuality even when that individuality may   stem from the use of &ldquo;national&rdquo; or regional culture as a source of inspiration.   On the other hand the free exchange of ideas and knowledge among composers from   different countries can be a source of continued inventiveness while each   composer maintains his/her individuality as an essential element of artistic   creation. Indeed, if we look at the history of musical evolution, this form of   &ldquo;globalization&rdquo; has existed for many centuries.</p>

  </em></strong>The nationalization of hydro electricity One of   the most important events in Quebec&rsquo;s Quiet Revolution (1960-1976), a movement   in which Quebec took control of its economic and social development after   centuries of economic control by the English and social control by the Catholic   Church. Since that time, Hydro Quebec has been one of the mainstays of the   Quebec economy, and indeed its modern industrialized identity. L&rsquo;Eau blanche,   which translates as White Water, recounts the development of the first big   hydro-electric project in northern Quebec during the 1960s. The main character,   a Quebecois engineer, is portrayed as a pioneer of the new Quebec, but his   ability to persuade the Natives to support the Hydro project is as significant   as his ability to overcome engineering obstacles. This novel was written in   1992, shortly after the Oka crisis which pitted Quebecois against Natives in an   armed standoff over land claims issues. It is therefore significant that this   novel go back some 30 years to an important moment in Quebec&rsquo;s history to   re-examine these same issues. In this paper, it will be my contention that the   direct conflict between Native and non-Native rights to Quebec&rsquo;s resources is   resolved in the novel through the use of nationalist Quebec discourse that   forecloses Native subjectivity. Specifically, I will use Gayatri Spivak&rsquo;s   concept of the colonial subject to analyze the novel&rsquo;s representation of Native   characters. Spivak contends that bourgeois subjects of previously colonized   societies such as Quebec actively suppress the rights of subaltern populations   in the postcolonial territory in an effort to advance their own nationalist   interests. Indeed, in this novel the white characters, who are important figures   in are involved in an heroic effort to harness the land&rsquo;s energy to the Quebec   national cause. In order to succeed in this endeavour, however, it is necessary   to both acknowledge the Native presence in the north and to suppress the   opposition that their land claims represent.</p>

    Professor Hummer will present a case for   widespread literacy among the laity in early medieval Europe. Although the   period between the collapse of the western Roman Empire in the fifth century and   the emergence of European states in the twelfth century has been seen as an era   of orality and cultural decline (hence the Dark Ages in the public imagination   ), in reality early Europe was deeply dependent upon the written word.   Controversial is the extent of the penetration of writing beyond the ranks of   the clergy into lay society. A close examination of the evidence, in particular   monastic charters (i.e. property contracts between monasteries and their lay   patrons), reveals the extensive use and preservation of documents among lay   people. </p>

    Memory is becoming one   the leading concepts in literary and cultural studies. Originally developed   within cognitive and social psychology (and simultaneously but relatively   independently from these fields of academic psychology and with a different   focus, in psychoanalysis) the concept was developed in order to understand   individual minds. However, as early as the 1920s French social psychologist   Maurice Halbwachs explored an analogous use of &lsquo;memory&rsquo; to describe a collective   phenomenon, namely the shared memory of social groups such as families or   villagers. Within the last 20 years Halbwach&rsquo;s ideas were rediscovered and   greatly expanded on. This paper will a) review Halbwachs&rsquo; groundbreaking ideas   on collective memory; b) discuss two recent theories of collective memory by   German cultural historian Jan Assmann and French historian Pierre Nora; and c)   try to create a systematic model of collective memory based on Halbwachs,   Assmann, Nora and a wide variety of other research on the subject while also   integrating some of the major criticism of collective memory studies   (particularly those by German historian Wulf Kansteiner).</p>

  </em></strong>This Brown Bag   talk is part of a larger project in which I discuss the quotidian realities as   well as the relatively unexplored?but super-charged?theoretical implications of   adoptive breastfeeding and how it fits within contemporary debates surrounding   race, motherhood, and technological change in the United States. The   contemporary adoptive breastfeeding done by white adoptive mothers for their   non-white (usually black, &quot;biracial,&quot; Central American, Chinese, or Korean)   infants and toddlers is part of an ongoing longer history of transracial wet   nursing in the U.S. This current moment places individual adoptive mothers who   choose to breastfeed their children of color using supplementary devices herbs   and &quot;legal drugs&quot; into a history of relationships of power and privilege among   white mothers and poor mothers both white and of color. Such relationships have   both literally and theoretically been about raced and classed reproductive labor   and the inequalities that such arrangements turn upon. Thus I also argue that   adoptive breastfeeding of non-white children by their white adoptive mothers   combines technology, race, biology, and parenting in ways that are just as   telling as the &ldquo;sexier&rdquo; and more commonly discussed developments in reproductive   technology. </p>

  </em></strong>Because the family plays a critical role in the   socialization of children, parents presumably play a critical role in   determining whether or not their children misbehave. However, after over half a   century of research and opinions, findings and interpretations remain   contradictory. Despite these divergent views, most researchers have found at   least small, significant associations between some dimension of family context   and delinquency. In fact, a considerable body of research evidence suggests that   delinquency is related to various indicators of problematic family   characteristics, either structural (e.g., broken homes) or relational (e.g.,   parent-child attachment; discipline) in nature. </p>
  <p>Various theoretical perspectives which relate various dimensions of the   family to crime and delinquency will be discussed, followed by a brief,   historical review of the family and delinquency research literature.

  </em></strong>From antiquity to   the pre-modern period painting and sculpture have given shape and meaning to the   concept of the divine, and the visual image regularly has appeared as the focus   of religious activity. At no time was this tradition of representation more   vital than in the ancient world where the numinous image and its attributed   powers were of particular concern in the overlapping and interpenetrating   polytheistic religious systems of the Near East, Egypt, Greece, and Rome and the   monotheistic cultures of ancient Judaism and Christianity that grew up beside,   borrowed from, and came to supersede them.</p>
  <p align="justify">In modern scholarship, antiquity's numinous images have been   the subject of longstanding and lively inquiry, but that inquiry has been   limited in its results because each of these cultural traditions has been   considered in isolation. As a result there is as yet no clear understanding of   either the similarities or the differences among these cultures on such matters   as basic as the physical forms of images, their spatial or architectural   settings, or the patterns of decorum regulating the interaction with and   response to them. Further, while all ancient societies acknowledged the power of   the sacred image, they did not necessarily agree upon the nature of that power,   its legitimacy or appropriateness of use.</p>

In part to establish   &ldquo;Scottie&rdquo; Ferguson (James Stewart) and Madeleine/Judy (Kim Novak) as repeating   this archetypal romantic tragedy. But even here Hitchcock adds a modern concern   absent both in the Tristan story and the Narcejac/Boileau novel. <em>Vertigo</em> describes Scottie&rsquo;s romance as a kind of self-deception.</p>
