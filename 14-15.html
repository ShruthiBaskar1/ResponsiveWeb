    <p><strong><u>September 09 - Lisabeth M. Hock</u></strong> <br />
           <b>CMLLC, Associate Professor.<em> Close and Distant Reading of Women's Melancholy</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> A number of texts by women writers in the first half of the nineteenth century are notable for their heroines&rsquo; uncontainable passion and excess of emotion, particularly those two emotions most closely related to melancholy: excessive fear and sadness. Sara Seldorf, the heroine of Terese Huber&rsquo;s Familie Seldorf (The Family Seldorf 1795), is the daughter of a depressed father. Although she pulls off impressive military feats in the guise of a man during the French revolution, she looks forward at the novel&rsquo;s conclusion only to her death, and until then to the resigned mothering of the child of her lover and his wife. Johanna Schopenhauer&rsquo;s ?three-volume Gabriele (1819-1821) became a model for the female Entsagungsroman (novel of renunciation), with its heroine mourning one lost love after another. Despite her considerable talents, intellectual drive, wealth, and beauty, the eponymous heroine of Ida von Hahn-Hahn&rsquo;s Sibylle (1846) finds herself incapable of loving either men or God and wastes away at the end of the novel. All three of these heroines are marked as exceptional but also as brooding and different from the others around them, and eventually all renounce that for which they seem to long the most. All three of these novels rely extensively on detailed descriptions of places, events, and emotional reactions to communicate the heroine&rsquo;s melancholy moods. And in all three, &ldquo;melancholy&rdquo; and related terms such as &ldquo;Tiefsinn&rdquo; and &ldquo;Schwermut&rdquo; occur frequently. ?My hypothesis is that the writers employ the notion of melancholy as an aesthetic category intended to underscore their and their characters&rsquo; &ldquo;superb sense of the sublime&rdquo; (Kant, Beobachtungen ?ber das Gef?hl des Sch?nen und Erhabenen&rdquo;). One sees this in Huber&rsquo;s descriptions of the horrors of the French Revolution, Schopenhauer&rsquo;s descriptions of tableau scenes and social events, and Hahn-Hahn&rsquo;s detailed descriptions of place. This strategy served to legitimize women&rsquo;s expressions of emotions as appropriate to the circumstances as opposed to being merely excessive. ?My presentation will employ close reading, socio-historical analysis, and digital humanities practices such as data mining to ask whether one can talk about an aesthetics of melancholy in these texts.</p>

  <b>Communication, Professor and Chair.<em> Professional Courage: Daily Duties that Sustain Journalistic Excellence</em></b><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> Courage is one of the four cardinal Greek virtues that finds a place in the writings of Confucius. Contemporary cultures define courage in the form of exceptional, bold acts. This paper places courage within the larger philosophical discussion of character and the impact of emotion on ethical action. ?It also situates courage within a concept of journalism as professional practice. Courageous journalists need the support of courageous organizations. While acknowledging that certain exceptional situations require individual courage, this paper suggests that the kind of courage that forms professional character is based in daily duties that hold even the most routine journalistic chores to a high ethical standard. This routine articulation of high standards, the practice of courage on a daily basis, builds both individual and organizational character. The result is professional solidarity, the courage to engage in bold acts where required, emerging standards of professional excellence, and the potential strengthening of ties between journalists and the public whom they serve..</p>

  <b>Political Science, Assistant Professor.<em> Two Narratives of Intergenerational Sustainability: The Case of Museums as Safeguards of the Interests of Future Generations</em></b><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> What makes organizations intergenerationally sustainable, and what helps them to survive? What is intergenerational sustainability, and how does it translate into managerial strategies? Professor Moldavanova uses the case of museums as examples of intergenerationally sustainable institutions, and explores the logic and ethic of intergenerational sustainability. The presentation is based on a larger study of arts organizations that explores the determinants of institutional resilience and management strategies that enhance the long-term sustainability of the arts. Two narratives of intergenerational sustainability emerge from the study: institutional resilience and institutional distinctiveness. These narratives co-exist, while at times contradicting each other, and it becomes the task of museum managers to reconcile the tensions embedded in these narratives..</p>

<p><strong><u>September 17 - Robert Allen Sedler</u></strong> <br />
  <b>Law School, Distinguished Professor.<em> The Constitution and Same Sex Marriage</em></b><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> Constitutional law develops in ?line of growth. The Supreme Court decides cases, and its decisions in these cases provide doctrine and precedent for future cases involving similar issues. In 2003,the Supreme Court decided Lawrence v. Texas, in which the Court held that it was unconstitutional for a state to prohibit consensual sex by same-sex persons. The Court stated that the state could not justify discrimination against same sex persons because of notions of ?&quot;morality&quot; or &quot;prejudice&quot; against them.<br />
  Following that decision, Professor Sedler published a law review article in the Wayne Law Review entitled ?&quot;The Constitution Should Protect the Right to Same Sex marriage.&quot; Professor Sedler contended that the state could assert no legitimate reason to prohibit same sex marriage and that because bans on same sex marriage caused very significant legal, financial, social, and psychological harms to same sex couples and their children, those bans were unconstitutional.<br />
  In recent years, there have been numerous cases throughout the nation, challenging the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriage, including ?DeBoer v.Snyder in Michigan. Professor Sedler will discuss these cases,and present the arguments demonstrating why a ban on same sex marriage is unconstitutional.</p>

<p><strong><u>September 23 - Jonathan Cottrell</u></strong> <br />
  <b>Philosophy, Assistant Professor.<em> Hume's Theory of the Imagination</em></b><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> According to Descartes and numerous other early modern philosophers, we can think in two different ways: 1) we can imagine, or think about things by forming sensory images of them; 2) we can think in a purely intellectual way, without the aid of sensory images. In the?<em>Treatise of Human Nature</em>, David Hume rejects this view: according to him, there is no such thing as purely intellectual thought; instead, all thinking is &lsquo;imagining,&rsquo; in Descartes&rsquo;s sense of that term?that is, all thinking consists in forming sensory images. This claim was controversial in Hume's time and seems obviously false to many readers?<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1069_com_zimbra_date"><span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT20_com_zimbra_date">today</span></span>. In this talk, I discuss Hume's possible motivations for this claim and some of its implications.</p>

<p><strong><u>September 24 - Stella Resko</u></strong> <br />
  <b>Social Work and Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute, Assistant Professor.<em> The Emotional Impact of Conducting Violence Research</em></b><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> Researchers increasingly recognize the emotional challenges that emerge when conducting &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; research on topics such as violence and trauma. The purpose of the current study was to examine the emotional challenges of conducting both qualitative and quantitative violence and trauma research. Semi-structured qualitative interviews (n=34) were used to examine the experiences of research team members&rsquo; working directly with participants and the impact of the study&rsquo;s quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method orientation on their experiences. The purposefully selected sample of adults worked as research assistants, interviewers, or study clinicians (6+ months). Although some emotional challenges were more frequently identified by those working on primarily quantitative studies (e.g. difficulty remaining objective, the toll of working with larger numbers of participants) many challenges were identified by those working on both quantitative or qualitatively-oriented studies (e.g. difficulty seeing/ hearing about certain types of trauma, difficulty with participant&rsquo;s reactions [e.g. crying or no emotional reaction at all]). Findings suggest emotional challenges are an important and often overlooked aspect of quantitative research. These challenges need to be taken into account by investigators planning both quantitative and qualitative research on violence and other emotionally sensitive topics.</p>

  <b>Abstract:</b> &ldquo;Connecting the Dots in Detroit: Water Shutoffs, Emergency Management, Bankruptcy &amp; Beyond&rdquo; explores the common roots of the problems facing Detroit ? grounding the analysis in the convergent influences of structural racism and fiscal austerity. ?The lessons implicit in this frame are used to evaluate the analysis of Detroit Future City, The Blight Removal Task Force Report and the City&rsquo;s Plan of Adjustment. This triad of self-referential documents has common flaws. ?These documents present ahistorical analyses of the problems facing the city, refusing to address issues of race or the relationship between the city and the region. ?These are neither innocent nor minor omissions, raising serious questions about the propriety and effectiveness of their collective recommendations. ?Alternative approaches will be explored, explicitly addressing the needs of Detroit from the perspective of the Three Rs of &ldquo;Race, Regionalism and Reconciliation.</p>

       <b>Abstract:</b> Between&nbsp;February 1971&nbsp;and&nbsp;July 1973, President Richard Nixon secretly recorded  3,700 hours of his phone calls and meetings across the executive offices.  Currently, approximately 3,000 hours of these tapes have been declassified,  released, and made available to the public. Neither the National Archives and  Records Administration (NARA) or the Nixon Presidential Library have produced  official transcriptions or made the complete audio files available online. Instead,  they have left this monumental task ? a task that NARA once estimated took 130 hours of staff  time to transcribe 1 hour of tape ? to individual researchers and scholars.</p>

       <b>Social Work, Assistant Professor.<em> Journeys of Older Adults: Making meaning in the (re)making of homes</em></b><br />
       <b>Abstract:</b> Concerns of appropriate housing may arise in older adulthood. ?Some older adults may make life work in the place we call home; others take steps to voluntarily relocate in anticipation of health and other needs. While moving at any age can be challenging, moving from one&rsquo;s home in later life also represents multiple reflections: past, present and future selves, control of one&rsquo;s space and relinquishing the care of one&rsquo;s space to another person or corporation, family support and family fissures, and the body&rsquo;s capacities and limitations. Moving is examined as a moment where regimes of value are negotiated through competing semiotic ideologies and at times social roles are transformed. ?Ethnographic fieldwork occurred from?<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT211_com_zimbra_date">January 2009</span>-<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT212_com_zimbra_date">May 2012</span>?in the Midwest United States.

       <b> Law and Political Science, Professor.<em> The Limits of Civility: Viewpoint-Neutrality, 'Public Truths,' and Legitimate Discourse in the Good Society</em></b><br />
       <b>Abstract:</b> Much of the current rhetoric urging civility appeals to a  neutral proceduralism that mimics the prevalent constitutional principle that  &ldquo;under the First Amendment, there is no such thing as a false idea.&rdquo; &nbsp;This  neutral proceduralism neglects the significance of what Wilmoore Kendall termed  &ldquo;public truths&rdquo;: &nbsp;&ldquo;standards upon whose validity a society is entitled to  insist.&rdquo; &nbsp;In the good society, Kendall  insisted (contra John Stuart Mill), not all questions can be open questions.  &nbsp;Civility acknowledges that the person being addressed is a legitimate  participant in the conversation. &nbsp;In a given instance, one may have an  arguable justification for withholding or repudiating such an acknowledgment.</p>
     <p> Beneath the surface of civility controversies lies a substantive debate about  what propositions can and cannot be insisted upon. &nbsp;Contemporary  controversies -- for example, over reactions against various invited campus  speakers, over activities relating to the movement to boycott Israel  (&quot;BDS&quot;), and over &quot;microaggressive&quot; disparagements that  implicate race, ethnicity, gender, disability, weight, and other distinctions  -- can usefully be re-examined in this light. &nbsp;A credible argument for  civility must concede that incivility, too, has its place in the good society.</p>

       <b>Abstract:</b> Inter-imperial rivalry, which embodied everything from diplomatic intrigues to military clashes, was one of the recurrent themes in the first two hundred years of the post-Colombian evolution of the Caribbean. ?In early 1797, the British wrested the island of Trinidad, and shortly thereafter, in a campaign that lasted from?<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT229_com_zimbra_date">April 17</span>until?<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT230_com_zimbra_date">May 2</span>, attempted to seize Puerto Rico. ?However, this time the English invaders suffered a major setback. ?The well-entrenched and determined local defenders, the majority of them of mixed racial background, out-maneuvered the British invaders, who were forced to retreat hastily to avoid their imminent destruction or capture.?? ? ?</p>
     <p>The armed conflict adversely impacted non-Hispanic European immigrants in Puerto Rico. ?Three days into the battle, a cluster of Irish settlers associated with the re-emergence of commercial agriculture in the Spanish colony were accused of aiding and abetting the enemy. ?They were placed under surveillance, arrested and jailed, and eventually cast off the island.</p>
     <p>The deportation order took many local residents, including local supporters of the Irish, by surprise. This presentation examines the anti-foreign backlash in the context of the economic revival of the Spanish American colonial periphery in the late Bourbon era. ?Using the expulsion proceeding against the Irish planter-administrator Jaime O'Daly y Blake, I suggest that the real or perceived economic success of the deportees, not their purported disloyalty, was the unstated driving force behind the hostile reaction. ?The evidence presented will argue that their entrepreneurial success did not sit well with some members of the colonial administration and Creole elite, who made up the trumped up charges in a poorly disguised ploy to drive out the ambitious aliens. </p>

       <b>Anthopology, Associate Professor.<em> Language and Exchange</em></b><br />
       <b>Abstract:</b> In this paper, I propose a theoretical account of some links between the ways people exchange goods and services with each other and the ways they communicate and think about language. ?My understanding of exchange builds on the Maussian tradition in anthropology, which distinguishes between reciprocal gift exchange embedded in social relationships and impersonal market exchange. ?I redefine this contrast so as to emphasize the communicative framing of exchange, thus linking exchange and language by definition. ?This link has further logical entailments as well as causal implications. ?Gift and market exchange generate different conceptualizations of social actors and their obligations: in reciprocity, actors are persons enmeshed in ongoing mutual obligations that cannot be precisely, fully specified; in the market, they are autonomous agents who rely on (ideally) transparently communicated information about commodities and intentions in order to negotiate and enter into explicit commitments. ?In analyzing the differences in the communication surrounding gift and market exchange, I draw on Peircean semiotics and on work in linguistic pragmatics and metapragmatics?Grice's theory of implicature, speech-act theory, and linguistic and anthropological critiques of those theories' claims to universality. ?Language and exchange are both such fundamental features of human social life that a theoretically coherent account linking the two generates a broad range of new questions and insights.</p>

       <b> CMLLC, Assistant Professor.<em> Writing in Color: On the Possibilities of Textual Reterritorialization of Painting</em></b><br />
       <b>Abstract:</b> Published by the Editions  Maeght in 1966, Femmes by French novelist Claude Simon is a hybrid work that  stands at the intersection of the visual and the textual. Asked to write a text  that would accompany twenty-three reproductions of works by Joan Mir?, Simon  produces a sui generis work ? sixty-nine prose fragments of varying length  whose main focus is the stroll of three women ? that stands apart in his ?uvre.  The text remains in many respects unclassifiable, in that 1) it does not  constitute a description of the paintings; 2) it uses the paintings as  &ldquo;generators&rdquo; for writing, but the connections between the illustrations and the  resulting text are not easily distinguishable; 3) it does not offer a critical  exegesis of the paintings, but rather a m?lange of associations, aesthetic  impressions, and memories stirred in the writer&rsquo;s mind by Mir?&rsquo;s creations.</p>
     <p> While literary theory alone cannot fully account for the complex interplay  between Simon&rsquo;s and Mir?&rsquo;s compositions, I posit that this relationship is  instead more aptly (and necessarily) informed by the Deleuze-Guattarian  concepts of territory, deterritorialization, and reterritorialization. Since  both media of expression (text and image) can be viewed as distinct artistic  domains or territories, Simon&rsquo;s textual reworking of Mir?&rsquo;s visual elements  functions as a deterritorialization and subsequent reterritorialization of  recycled colors, lines, shapes, figures, and textures on the one hand, and  underlying motifs, on the other hand. By focusing on a couple of paintings by  Mir?, I propose to trace in this talk how some of their components are  reterritorialized within Simon&rsquo;s text, where they also become part of new  compositional assemblages.</p>

       <b> CMLLC, Assistant Professor.<em> Gender Disparity and Divine Favor in the Qur'an</em></b><br />
       <b>Abstract:</b> Many Muslim and non-Muslim readers of the Qur&rsquo;an are troubled by the appearance of gender disparity in the scripture, and some have attempted to reread critical verses in ways that align more with modern sensibilities regarding gender equity. Of particular interest is Q. 4:34, traditionally understood to give men authority over women on account of God&rsquo;s &ldquo;favor&rdquo; (Arabic:?<em>faddala</em>). De Gifis challenges narrowly gendered readings of favor, which appear in claims for male ontological superiority, by situating the terminology of favor in its larger Qur&rsquo;anic context. Informed by classical Qur&rsquo;anic co-textual hermeneutics (<em>tafsir al-Qur&rsquo;an bi-al-Qur&rsquo;an</em>) andmodern semantic field analysis, she shows that while Q. 4:34 prescribes a normative role for man as caretaker of woman, the cause of acquiring God&rsquo;s favor and the authority derived therefrom are extrinsic to man. Since God&rsquo;s favor is a gift from His own bounty, whoever acquires a share is warned against jealous miserliness and entrusted with the moral duty to expend of it graciously in the world. By highlighting the language of acquisition and expenditure, De Gifis helps elucidate how specific gender regulations in the Qur&rsquo;an reflect the reality of socio-economic disparity while prompting its transmutation into a dynamic agency of equalization.</p>

       <b>Music, Assistant Professor.<em> Musical representations of the American Working Class in the Songs of Billy Joel </em></b><br />
       <b>Abstract:</b> Billy Joel (b. 1949), an American musician whose career spanned the 1970s through the 2000s, is perhaps most famous for his ballads and love songs. ?A closer look at his musical output, however, reveals a keen ability to translate more general aspects of American culture into compelling musical narratives. ?Several of his compositions address American working class life in the latter twentieth century. ?This talk examines three songs, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t No Crime&rdquo; (1973), &ldquo;Allentown&rdquo; (1982), and &ldquo;Downeaster &lsquo;Alexa&rsquo;&rdquo; (1990), in an effort to trace Joel&rsquo;s perspectives on the issues they raise?boredom and frustration with quotidian blue-collar routines and the dismantling of American industries?and their musical expression through style markers that reference blues, gospel, rock, and folk. ?Although these songs vary stylistically, they also share certain compositional choices that position them, implicitly and explicitly, as the composer&rsquo;s statements, a hallmark of the singer-songwriter milieu. ?Moreover, they demonstrate how Joel&rsquo;s music reflects not only his personal views, but also his perceptive observations of broader American culture in the late twentieth century..</p>

       <b>Abstract:</b> Two of the most important concerns for the viability of our modern societies in the United States and the World are the rise to exaggerated seizure of capital resources by the 1% and the threat of climate change to our the global ecosystem.   On the surface, these appear to be recent phenomena of the late 20th and early 21st centuries that are only distantly related to each other.  My thesis here is that they have deep roots in human history and they are so intimately and intricately linked that they must be addressed together as threats, not only to modern civilization, but to life on earth as we know it.  In this talk, I will use a model created by anthropologist-historian Eric Wolf that analyzes how human society organize their collective labor forces according to three modes of production: 1. Kinship Mode; Tributary Mode; and Capitalist Mode.  I will argue that a historical 1% rose to power with the Tributary Mode through the concentrated use of military and political power before morphing into the Capitalist Mode of exploitation that has led the human species to devastate its home planet.</p>

       <b> English, Assistant Professor.<em> The Talking Dead: Exhortations of the Dead to the Living in Anglo-Saxon Literature</em></b><br />
       <b>Abstract:</b> In this paper, I explore one subgenre of homiletic writing in Anglo-Saxon England, that of the &ldquo;exhortation of the dead to the living.&rdquo; These exhortations involve the corpse (usually decayed) addressing those who have come to gawk at it, delivering a lecture on the perishable human body and permanence of one&rsquo;s eternal fate. My analysis builds on two fields: first, the appearance of the exhortation motif in Anglo-Saxon writing and material culture; and second, death studies and archaeologies that explore the agency of the dead body in directing the behavior of the living. In doing so, I develop a broader picture about ways in which &ldquo;the dead&rdquo;?both bodies and souls?function as members of the &ldquo;city of God,&rdquo; acting in concert with the living to reinforce community ties. By exploring this spectacle, in which the ultimate passive object becomes an agent and speaking party, turning the gaze of assessment back on its viewers, forcing its audience to consider their own mortality and the stability of the Christian community and their citizenship within it..</p>

     <b>Abstract:</b> Photography and ideas about the "American West" developed in tandem, increasing in cultural significance throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and have informed ideas about each other ever since. As photography has proliferated, so too have our visual representations of the West. Perhaps because of its recognizability and its aesthetic appeal, photographic images of the West have become visual stereotypes andclich?d shorthands for beauty and American values. </p>
   <p>From the Mountains will address my recent photographic work that uses images of the American West as a starting point to interpret and confront cultural myths surrounding the representation of that landscape.  Focusing on land that has been protected from man's physical alteration (National Parks, Monuments, and Preserves) and whose cultural and economic value is determined through aesthetic reframing, the work uses physical alterations to photographic imagery of the West to create relationships between formal geometries and natural spaces that question the illusionistic representation of the photographic image, interrupting the fantasy of an untouched and untouchable vista.</p>

     <b>History, Associate Professor. <em>&quot;Words as Hard as Cannon-Balls&quot;: American Experiences of Liberty of Speech in the Long Nineteenth Century</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> The suggested reading represents a somewhat dated prospectus for an exploration of Americans&rsquo; conceptions and experiences of liberties now associated with the First Amendment. Well into the late 20th century, the subject and objects of First Amendment historical scholarship were shaped less by historians than by the federal judiciary&rsquo;s sense of historical significance. The master narrative commenced roughly with World War I and the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s rulings in cases involving political dissent. ?Recently, scholars have pushed that history back into the late 19th century, but, again, largely by interrogating lower court records for evidence of additional, formal, judicial utterances. The fact that Margaret Sanger &lsquo;spoke&rsquo; in transgressive ways and described her speech acts as constitutionally protected fails to make its way into First Amendment scholarship because no First Amendment case arose. Similarly, when women picketed the White House on the eve of World War I to demand the right to vote, or when Maria Stewart defied convention by speaking of rape and other forbidden topics in public, constitutional historians typically ignored them; no case had arisen, and &lsquo;symbolic speech&rsquo; had not yet been embraced by constitutional lawyers. ?In his Dred Scott ruling, Chief Justice Roger Taney pronounced freedom of speech the single most dangerous liberty of all, to be withheld from black people at all costs. &ldquo;Words as Hard as Cannon-Balls&rdquo; digs beneath the formal record to assess rights consciousness and actual experiences of liberty of speech and press during the long nineteenth century, when common-law conceptions of what we now call 'preferred freedoms' shaped behavior. ?Liberty of speech, far from being distributed evenly throughout society, was sharply constrained and often experienced vicariously ? as when women&rsquo;s speeches were read in public by men. I argue, too, that the right to vote was viewed by many women as an aspect of liberty of speech and a component of First Amendment guarantees, again well into the 1890s.</p>

     <b>Library and Information Science, Professor. <em>The Complicity of Research Universities in Creating the Scholarly Communication Crisis</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> The complicity of research universities in creating the scholarly communication crisis has not received sufficient attention. As 
     faculty face increased pressure to publish their research to gain tenure and promotion, commercial publishers have obliged 
     by increasing the number of expensive publications with price increases far above the inflation rate for the consumer price 
     index. Academic libraries struggle to pay for these journals in a time of resource scarcity. New strategies such as open access 
     have tried to reduce costs without much success. What is usually overlooked is that universities bear much sponsibility for 
     this crisis by rewarding faculty who publish in these expensive commercial journals with a high impact factor. Furthermore, 
     universities that wish to increase their reputation in the scholarly community are especially eager to have their faculty publish 
     in prestigious journals. A large part of the problem is that faculty on tenure and promotion committees have difficulty in judging 
     the quality of publications outside their disciplines and depend upon journal prestige. One possible solution would be to create 
     reviewing boards with enough rigor to allow faculty to bypass the expensive commercial publications but still receive academic 
     reward.</p>

     <b>Abstract:</b> The term Time Travel refers to the incredibly high level of the preservation afforded to historical artifacts by the Arctic's dry and cold climate. It also refers to the sensation that while in the Arctic one is looking bluntly into the future. Because it is difficult to ignore the absolute simplicity and beauty of this landscape, it is also virtually impossible to overlook physical evidence of climate dynamics. Acknowledging this while maintaining a somewhat objective research practice is a balancing act. It requires a deeper investigation into the politics and the social implications of a rapidly changing corner of the world that was once deemed savage and undesirable.<br />

     <b> English, Lecturer.<em> War and Truth: Ideological Conflict and the Matter of Veterans Writing</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> Since the Post-9/11 GI Bill passed in 2009, universities and colleges, many designated as &quot;military friendly,&quot; have experienced a dramatic change in their student demographic. A first wave of research about student-veterans has emerged; that research focuses primarily on veterans' transition to civilian life, the impact of signature wounds (TBI and PTS) on learning, and the need for universities to implement support services, such as GI Bill benefits coordinators. Partly absent in this initial research has been overt discussion of the moral imperatives and ideological conflicts that veterans' presence in our classrooms and communities can make poignant and pressing. This presentation offers such discussion. As part of a research effort that is more politically self-conscious, the presentation details a campus-community collaboration conducted with members of the national Warrior Writers project (<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT242_com_zimbra_url"><a target="_blank" class="normalA" href="http://www.warriorwriters.org/">www.warriorwriters.org</a></span>) and shares Iraq veterans' self-sponsored creative writing and visual representation. Implications of the collaboration and representations are outlined for those working with vets in higher education, particularly in college writing classrooms.</p>

     <b> Sociology, Associate Professor.<em> Limits to Social Sustainability: An Unattainable Goal?</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract: </b>Sustainability is all the current rage when speaking about manufacturing, community development or as a goal for the future. ?But when most people speak of sustainability, they are referring to environmental sustainability?green jobs, renewable resources, non-fossil fuel modes of transportation, and the like. ?But when we speak of social sustainability, it is unclear what we mean. ?We all have an implicit understanding that it means the ability of communities to prosper, investments in plant and equipment that will support local economies, and the like. ?Our vision of the socially sustainable landscape is a utopian. ?We think about jobs, but not about whether these are jobs local unemployed workers can qualify for. ?We think of housing, but not necessarily for the homeless. ?The talk?<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT205_com_zimbra_date">today</span>?will explore some of the assumptions we make about social sustainability, and present the limits to and constraints on achieving that goal.</p>

     <b>Philosophy, Professor.<em> God Does Not Exist: The Best Explanation of all the Suffering We See</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract: </b>Suppose we take God to be a being who has at least the following three attributes: he is all-knowing, all-powerful, and wholly good. The problem of evil is that the existence of such a being seems incompatible with the huge amount of suffering of innocents that we observe in the world. You would think that a wholly good God would prevent a lot more of it if he knew about it and had the power to prevent it, as he does if he exists. It is not that the existence of such a God is incompatible with any suffering, but it seems incompatible with so much. I will give three versions of the argument from evil against the existence of God and defend one of them against what has been called the free will defense and against what has been called Skeptical Theism, which says that we are in no position to judge that there is excessive, unnecessary suffering in the world.</p>

    <b>Criminal Justice, Professor.<em> The Interrogation of Criminal Suspects in China: A Complex Cultural Process</em></b><br />
    <b>Abstract:</b>Police interrogation practices around the world fall into three general categories: physically coercive, psychologically coercive, and less-coercive cognitive interviewing techniques. ?Police interrogation in China in routine criminal cases, along with many Asian countries, relies substantially on physical coercion. ?Reliance on coercive techniques is not immune to change. Abusive police interrogation in United States during the third-degree era less than a century ago, for example, transitioned to psychologically coercive methods. ?The best available data suggest that half of all routine police interrogations in China involve torture, even though torture is forbidden by law. Chinese legal doctrine has trended toward strict exclusionary rules, but institutions are slower to change, making the effective suppression of police torture questionable. ?In this talk I speculate that recent legal changes point to tension between the central government's reforms and local practice realities. Any thoroughgoing changes will reflect the felt needs of the one-party state.</p>

    <b> English, Adjunct Professor.<em> The Holy Girl</em></b><br />
    <b>Abstract:</b>&ldquo;The World Will be Watching&rdquo; explores the distinction between fame and celebrity by arguing that the public nature of celebrity makes it simultaneously a panoptic prison and an economic system in which a person can participate, rather than the means of leaving a legacy of fame. The paper considers the celebrity of reality television and juxtapositions the forced celebrity found within The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins with the chased celebrity found in Lauren Conrad&rsquo;s two trilogies, LA Candy and Fame Game. ?The essay addresses the panoptic nature of celebrity and questions whether choosing to be viewed is a way of commodifying oneself, imprisoning oneself, or possibly both. ?The paper explores the way celebrity creates docile bodies, as described by Michel Foucault, through fear (often of losing social status), as well as a desire to participate in the economic system of celebrity. Joshua Gamson argues people embrace celebrity culture and allow themselves to be viewed for both economic gain and cultural influence. This behavior is seen both in The Hunger Games and LA Candy. ?Although Katniss&rsquo;s primary motive, initially, is not to make money--she simply wants to survive--she knows about, and frequently comments on, the incomparable wealth gained by the Games&rsquo; winning tribute. In contrast, Madison Parker, in Conrad&rsquo;s novels, is in the game for the money. She makes it clear that she believes celebrity is the only path that will allow her to afford the life she desires. This essay explores the choices made by the characters in these novels and the results from that placement under the public gaze.</p>

    <b>Abstract:</b> While much of Detroit continues to suffer from steady population loss, the adjacent neighborhoods of Midtown and Downtown show clear signs of revival. Each has been the target of major revitalization investments, primarily from the corporate and philanthropic sectors, and of carefully structured efforts to increase neighborhood population by stimulating both housing demand and housing supply. The investment strategies deployed have some critical elements in common, as well as some notable differences, but the programs designed to stimulate residential demand ? Live Midtown and Live Downtown -- are virtually identical. They were launched at almost the same time, are administered by the same nonprofit agency, and offer the same attractive package of financial incentives for employees of participating employers to move to the neighborhood. The presentation will compare and contrast the experience to date of this &ldquo;natural experiment&rdquo; during its initial three years.</p>

            <b> History, Associate Professor.<em> An American in Kyoto: Edward Parrish and the Japanese Tobacco Industry in the early 20th Century</em></b><br />
            <b>Abstract:</b>In 1899, Edward Parrish arrived in Kyoto as the first vice president of Murai Brothers &amp; Co., Ltd. This firm represented a new joint venture between the Murai Brothers, one of Japan's largest cigarette manufacturers, and the American Tobacco Co. Before the merger, James Duke had sought various ways to expand American Tobacco's presence in Asia. Direct investment in a Japanese manufacturer proved the most expedient route, and in Murai Brothers Duke found a company needing capital due to too rapid expansion and looming payments for imported tobacco leaf and bank loans. One of Duke's requirements for American Tobacco investment was that his company have managerial control, and that came in the person of Parrish. A former lay Methodist preacher and tobacco auctioneer, Parrish oversaw the fortunes of Murai Brothers for the next five years, before the Japanese government established monopoly control over tobacco. The letters that Parrish wrote to American and then British Tobacco executives shed light on the nature of doing business in Japan in the early 20th century. This talk will discuss in particular challenges, including problems with counterfeiters, jobbers, and customs agents, as well as charges of unpatriotic activity, which were unique to Murai Brothers within the tobacco industry.</p>

            <b>Abstract:</b> Religious and secular conquest ideologies justify the power of ruling groups over their own peoples and the making of war on others.  Internally, they legitimize the systems of laws and customs that are used to socially control and tax domestic populations.  Externally, they explain the moral and cultural superiorities that require the subjugation of other peoples as tributaries and slaves.  Conquest ideologies further transform the meaning of acts of violence into acts of paternalistic charity.  Citizens are provided with good government, jobs, and public safety.  Alien populations have their deaths in war commuted to lifetime slavery; they are saved from the Devil and the tyranny of their own rulers; and their humanities are elevated by assimilation into the True Faith and True Civilization.  Effective conquest ideologies implant themselves as normalized worldviews in the subject populations and organize all areas of thought an action in a society.</p>

            <b>Abstract:</b> Across America, and indeed, throughout the developed world, schools, colleges, and universities grapple with the reality of differential graduation rates for dominant culture and minoritized youth. The challenge, in today's volatile, ambiguous and changing world, is to find ways to ensure that all students have equitable opportunities to succeed. This presentation will describe the author's journey to transformative leadership, its history, tenets, and the ways in which it can provide a socially just way forward. The presentation will provide an overview of the theory and how it differs from other leadership theories, particularly transformational leadership. Then, using stories and anecdotes from practice, it will demonstrate the potential of transformative leadership to create equitable and socially just learning environments for all students. In short, the goal is to make the theory come to life in a way that will also offer a call to action.</p>

              <b> Center for Latino/a and Latin America Studies and History, Associate Director. <em>Quixote en Exilio: Representations of the Tragicomic Figure by Mexican Revolutionary Writers
in Exile</em></b><br />
              <b>Abstract:</b>Cervantes&rsquo; quintessential work of Spanish Golden Age literature, El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha (1605), is one of the most influential?and most imitated?novels of all 
              time. Like other writers throughout the western world, Mexican novelists also routinely draw
             upon the tradition of quixotic imitation as a trope in their own writing. </p>
            <p> In two of the earliest known examples of Mexican-American literature, transnational Mexican
              novelists, Daniel Venegas and Conrado Espinoza, rely heavily on the work of the &ldquo;Great Poet&rdquo; to
              help shape their novels of Mexican immigration while writing in exile in the United States.
              This presentation will examine how Espinoza&rsquo;s El sol de Texas (1926) and Venegas&rsquo; Las
              aventuras de don Chipote (1928) make use of the tradition of quixotic imitation for both tragic
              and satirical purposes, exploring the enchantment and disenchantment experienced by Mexican
             immigrants pursuing the American Dream in the wake of the Mexican Revolution.</p>

              <b>Abstract:</b> There has been a recent resurgence in sociological and criminological scholarship involving the construct of morality. ?Research on antecedents and consequences of moral convictions within organizational contexts, however, remains quite rare. Further, studies that have explored the link between moral beliefs and ethical workplace behaviors have been limited to those behaviors that can clearly be located within the moral-immoral demarcation (e.g., theft, dishonesty, abuse, sabotage, etc.). Thus, knowledge of the processes by which moral beliefs function to guide everyday workplace behaviors, more generally, remains limited. ?In response, this study analyzes data derived from an online survey of restaurant servers (n=940) in an attempt to explore the links between moral convictions towards customer service and a diffuse set of employee behavioral/attitudinal outcomes. Our findings taken as a whole suggest that the organizational benefits of attracting and retaining morally motivated employees may extend far beyond those outcomes typically thought to constitute ethical/unethical workplace behaviors.</p>

             <b>Abstract: </b>Born in London, trained at the Royal College of Music, and referred to as the &ldquo;Black Mahler,&rdquo; Afro-British composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912) considered his mission in life to assist in establishing the honor and dignity of the black man through music. He was significantly inspired by not only the African-American poet P.L. Dunbar, setting several of Dunbar&rsquo;s poems to music, but also by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, W.E.B. Du Bois, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington and others, whose works he copiously studied. As a result of meeting Dunbar in 1897 his awareness of his heritage expanded and led to such works as the African Romances (1897), the operatic romance Dream Lovers (1898), the African Suite (1898) Toussaint l'ouverture (1901), a musical illustration of the 18th-century slave who led the liberation of Haiti, and 24 Negro Melodies (1905). This presentation considers the impact of multiculturalism through semiotics in the aforementioned musical works of Coleridge-Taylor and their significance for audiences in the twenty-first century.</p>

              <b>Abstract: </b>Countless man-hours and expertise have been used to create records describing items held in cultural heritage institutions (libraries, archives, and museums). While these records are critical to the daily operations of institutions, the descriptive information contained within the records has not been used to its fullest potential. This presentation focuses on how information visualization techniques using descriptive records can reveal aspects concerning the collection holdings of cultural heritage institutions. This data, when visualized, can uncover information about institutional collections across a number of dimensions (type of object, subject content, location of manufacture, authorship, etc.), as well as revealing aspects regarding collecting histories. Information visualization techniques, since they allow us to examine data in the aggregate, have the potential to transform the way we think about collections and the types of questions we can ask of them. The presentation ends by examining the implications of the visualizations for varied groups of individuals (scholars, general public, and institutional staff) interested in cultural heritage institutions.<br /><br />

             <b>Abstract:</b> Expanding an institution&rsquo;s online offerings can promise substantial institutional rewards: increased enrollment, lower facility costs, and the ability to compete with the ever-widening array of online education providers. Entering the online education marketplace, however, also poses significant risks for traditional institutions, like Wayne State, that are concerned with student retention, graduation rates, and constrained financial resources. This presentation will focus on two aspects of this developing conversation. First, English lecturer Thomas Trimble will compare student grade outcomes in face-to-face and online versions of the University&rsquo;s required general education writing course, ENG 1020 (Introduction to College Writing). Specifically, he&rsquo;ll explore the tendency for online students to &ldquo;thrive or dive&rdquo; compared to their peers enrolled in face-to-face sections of the same course. Second, English lecturer Clay Walker will address the advantages and disadvantages of using standardized course shells as a way of improving course cohesion across sections, improving student learning outcomes, and facilitating instructor training and professional development.</p>

              <b> Education, Assistant Professor.<em> Integrating Emotional Intelligence and Creative Thinking Into the Curriculum</em></b><br />
             <b>Abstract:</b> Colleges and Universities have been challenged to ensure that they graduate students who can think creatively. ? Ever since the birth of psychology, psychologists have been dealing with the term &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo;. In the earlier part of the 20th century, intelligence quotient (IQ) became an important issue. However, many psychologists have come up with different approaches to explaining intelligence. For example, Thorndike&rsquo;s (1920) &lsquo;Social Intelligence&rsquo;, Howard Gardner&rsquo;s (1993) &lsquo;Multiple Intelligence theory&rsquo;, and Daniel Goleman&rsquo;s (1995) &lsquo;Emotional Intelligence&rsquo; are some of the major concepts of intelligence. Emotional intelligence is a type of social intelligence, which involves the capacity for recognizing one&rsquo;s own feelings and those of others for motivating and managing emotions well in oneself and in one&rsquo;s relationships. EI refers to an array of competencies and skills that influence one&rsquo;s ability to succeed in coping with environmental demands and pressures. Specific processes which improve the ability to be creative, original, diverse and to elaborate ideas. This presentation presents an overview of the conceptual framework of EI and CI.

              <b>Music, Academic Advisor II.<em> From Pedals to Strings: An exploration and demonstration of the modern concert harp</em></b><br />
              <b>Abstract:</b>The harp is a versatile instrument capable of producing numerous sound effects. ?While the perception of this instrument is commonly limited to ethereal glissandi and supple harmonics, the harp has a symphonic range of effects as realized through the ingenuity of master harpist Carlos Salzedo. ?The pedagogical legacy of Carlos Salzedo, his influence on compositional techniques for harp and his pivotal role in bringing the harp into the twentieth century will be discussed.?<br />
             This presentation will cover the full spectrum of the harp and the evolution of the instrument from six to forty-seven strings.?The function of the harp in various contexts (i.e. solo, chamber, harp ensemble and orchestra) will be discussed along with a live performance of pieces composed specifically for harp to demonstrate the subtle and striking nuances of the instrument. There will also be an opportunity for an up close examination of various types of harps after the demonstration.</p>

              <b>Abstract:</b> This paper re-examines the study of immigrant mental health by arguing that the level of economic 
development, as measured by level of GNP of country of origin, alters the initial and subsequent metal health trajectories ? measured by depression -- over time. Using five-waves of longitudinal survey data from the National Population Health Survey of adults living in three Metropolitan cities in Canada (N=2,891), results show a clear pattern of change in depression, but mainly among immigrants from lower GNP countries of origin. Change in stress exposure and mastery explains the trajectory in depression of immigrants from lower GNP backgrounds. The initial mental health advantage found exclusively in this group of immigrants remains unexplained, suggesting that either this group is the most selected or that other factors account for this association.</p>

             <b>Abstract:</b> Each week, more than one million individuals around the world engage in a unique form of artistic expression that actually involves more people than all other forms of adult recreation -- from bowling to theater -- combined. They raise their voices in song. Whether they do it in a local community center, a college or university rehearsal hall, a church, or simply in someone's living room, they come together to sing in a choir. Why do they do it? What does it take for composers who write what choirs sing to cross the line from silence into the world of sound? And how do those who write choral music make the journey from one art form to a very different one -- from words to music? Dr. Gerald Custer, a choral conductor as well as an award-winning composer, reveals the tools and strategies that he regularly employs to approach, unlock, and engage text: how it works, how it's structured, and what it means.</p>

             <b>Abstract: </b>Adele Gloria (1910-1984) was an Italian poet, painter, sculptor, and photographer who subscribed to futurism in the 1920s and 1930s. ?Born and raised in Catania, she was one of only a few to champion the futurist cause in Sicily and one of the few Italian futurist women in general. She contributed to futurist photography by creating photo collages from pictures that she took of herself. Her photographic work is unique in the futurist oeuvre; it differs dramatically from early futurist photographers such as Anton Giulio Bragaglia who employed fotodinamismo (&ldquo;photodynamism&rdquo;) and from the well-known female futurist photographer Wanda Wulz. I will contextualize Adele Gloria&rsquo;s work within the larger futurist movement while also placing it within a proto-feminist framework by looking at questions of self-portraiture, subjectivity and agency. ?This talk will include a brief, general introduction to Adele Gloria and her work since very little is known of her and will then go on to include close readings of a few of her photo collages.??</p>

              <b>Theatre and Dance, Associate Professor.<em> Mobile Homestead: Spatialities of Artistic Citizenship</em></b><br />
             <b>Abstract:</b> Mobile Homestead is a reconstruction of the artist Mike Kelley's childhood home in the Detroit suburb of Westland. Bearing several distinct, yet intertwined identities, the work is a nomadic sculpture, a site-specific installation, and a designated community space located at the Museum of Contemporary Art ? Detroit in Midtown. A bright white ranch-style structure, complete with a two-car garage and a patch of fertilized lawn, the work offers a complex meditation on space, place, time, memory and identity. It is autobiographical in the most direct way. Yet, because of the structure's unusual positioning within the city of Detroit, the work, like so many of Kelley's earlier sculptures, films and performances, is designed to expose and pervert its own autobiographical limitations. As Mobile Homestead juxtaposes the dream-architecture of 1950s suburbia against the emergent landscape of a tentatively revitalized sliver of urban space located in the center of one of the most abidingly violent, disenfranchised cities in the U.S., the work comments quizzically on the philosophical undercurrents of presence and absence, "insideness" and "outsideness" (Relph 1976) in Detroit.</p>

             <b>Abstract:</b> This work is part of a larger book project on the problem of identification across various forms  of moving-image media. In this paper, I offer a phenomenological and psychoanalytical description  of what I am calling the &ldquo;critical stupidity&rdquo; of the Jackass franchise across its various lives on  television, film, and the Internet. I argue that while it critically engages the psychic and technological  processes identification, it does so without calling for intellectual elaboration or elucidation.  Instead, Jackass stages the problems of sociality and community, but in a scene where what is  called for is not eloquence or intelligence, but rather inarticulate, embodied, stupid: groaning,  gasping, laughing, gagging, wincing.</p>

             <b>Abstract:</b>This talk will examine how the local Soviet court system functioned from its beginning in 1917, across the Stalinist Terror of the 1930s and into the Second World War through the biography of one man?Ivan Morozov. ?Morozov was born a peasant and never had extensive legal training but still moved up through the judicial system to become a judge of the regional Supreme Court. ?Drawing on his unpublished memoir and an analysis of his court cases, I will discuss how he judged cases in the local people&rsquo;s courts and tried to spread revolutionary justice to the populace. ?Morozov became part of the forced collectivization of agriculture and then got caught up in the Stalinist Purges?both as a judge and victim. ?His biography reveals how the Soviet system attempted to carry out justice in its local courts, while also pointing to the opportunity of social mobility in the early Soviet Union. ?This talk is based on my forthcoming book, &ldquo;In the Courts of Revolution: Legality, Vengeance, and Citizenship in the Rural Soviet Courtroom, 1917-1953.&rdquo;</p>

              <b>Music, Professor and Director of Orchestral Studies.<em> String Orchestra Gems by Josef Suk and Pyotr Tchaikovsky</em></b><br />
             <b>Abstract:</b>Professor Kypros Markou has completed a CD ?recording conducting the Dvorak Chamber Orchestra of Prague. The CD was published by Fleur de Son Classics, an eclectic record company in Buffalo NY, and is due to be released internationally in July by NAXOS. The CD features music by Josef Suk and Pyotr Tchaikovsky; some of the music such as the Serenade for Strings by Tchaikovsky is quite familiar. On the other hand Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s? Elegy in G is very rarely performed.? Also, Suk&rsquo;s Serenade for Strings and the Meditation on an Old Czech Chorale &ldquo;St. Wenceslas&rdquo;? are rarely performed outside of the Czech Republic.?</p>
<p>Professor Markou will discuss the process of producing the CD and present selected movements. The first step was to choose music that would present a special and distinctive combination.? The next step was to prepare the scores and the parts and to mark them appropriately. As with any other performance it is necessary to create a unique interpretation for each work to be performed.? The note symbols that have been written by the composer need to be brought to life with real sounds. The pacing, the emotion, the structure, the balance and blending of the sound and a myriad other details have to be thought out before the first encounter with the orchestra. Even then one has to allow enough flexibility and freedom so that the musicians will be active participants. An orchestra is not an instrument; it is a group of creative artists. It is necessary for ?a conductor to make a convincing case that his ?or her approach ?and interpretation offers a legitimate and passionate view that is true to the spirit of the composer.            </p>
<p>The recording sessions were intense. I arrived in Prague on?<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT533_com_zimbra_date"><span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT82_com_zimbra_date">Sunday</span></span>?and had one rehearsal on?<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT534_com_zimbra_date"><span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT83_com_zimbra_date">Monday</span></span>. Fortunately a number of the musicians had worked with me on two other occasions. I was also familiar with the Domovina studios and the recording engineer as well as the producer. For the Suk ? Tchaikovsky CD we had four long recording sessions.? Then, after a long wait I was sent the first edited tape. I listened to the tape many times with score in hand and then sent my comments. After another long wait I received a Master CD, which I submitted to Fleur de Son. I was very happy when I was informed that they accepted the CD for publication.? In addition to the recorded music informative notes had to be provided and I am very grateful to my colleague Dr. Mary Paquette Abt who provided excellent notes about the music. The CDs have now been produced and will be released internationally by NAXOS in July.</p>

     <b>Abstract:</b> Maize was one of the principal deities to emerge with the ascendance of farming and urbanism across much of Late Formative period Mesoamerica (i.e., after about 200 BC).  Instances of this diety?the "tonsured" (or, curiously, "foliated") maize god of the ancient Maya, Pitao Cozobi among the Zapotecs, Chicome-Xochitl of the Nahua and Homshuck to the Popoluca?are ubiquitous throughout this region by the onset of Classic period times (AD 300-900) and continue, ethnographically, into the present.  I examine several "sightings" of the maize god, a strikingly coiffed being oddly resembling Evis Presely (AD 1935-1977), made in a variety of Middle to Late Classic period contexts in the Gulf Coast lowlands.   The young maize god, representing a key player in an early mythological narrative of central Veracruz, may have inspired a host of depictions in in the art and monuments of some of the Gulf Coast's most important archaeological sites.   The talk explores the implications of maize symbolism in cosmology, rulership and political interaction among the complex societies of ancient Veracruz, Mexico.</p>

     <b>Abstract:</b> This presentation takes a peek into the multiple challenges women struggle with in binuclear families as employees and as parents handling dual responsibilities of bread winning and home making. It highlights "His" and "Her" challenges in this situation that make freedom of women a myth in these families. Women?today?in the name of freedom have not lost any of the past responsibilities of their gender while additional new ones have been added as a price for the demand of their independence. This makes women in the post modern society far more over burdened than any of their previous generations so far.</p>

     <b>Philosophy, Assistant Professor; Philosophy, Ph.D. Student.<em> Polygamy and Gender Equality: Understanding the Tension from Liberal and Islamic Perspectives</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> Polygamy has been left out of the on-going debates on which relationships should be sanctioned by a liberal democratic state.   The obvious explanation is that polygamy conflicts with the liberal commitment to moral equality.   Similarly, contemporary Muslim scholars disagree on the permissibility of polygamy because it may permit gender inequality.   In this talk, we examine the tension between polygamy and equality in both liberal and Islamic thought.   In a liberal society, equality is an important aim but not the sole aim.   Autonomy is a competing (if not more fundamental) value, and the liberal requirement to respect individual autonomy may override the requirement to promote equality.   There is reason to believe that liberal commitments protect the individual's choice to enter into a polygamous marriage, even if it violates gender equality.   On the other hand, it is reasonable to believe that Islamic law does not sanction polygamy because the overriding concern is justice. Muslim scholars, then, face a dilemma because the Qur'an permits polygamy. Three main interpretations of the law address this apparent inconsistency, and the most reasonable interpretation rejects polygamy as an Islamic marriage practice. This paper entertains the counter-intuitive conclusion that liberal commitments are compatible with polygamy, whereas Islam is not.</p>

     <b> CMLLC, Associate Professor and Interim Chair.<em> Binary Outlaws: Queering the Classical Tale in Fracois Ozon's Criminal Lovers and Catherine Breillat's Sleeping Beauty</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b>Approaching fairy-tale texts and films from the perspective of queer theory foregrounds the ways in which fairy-tale plots can subvert what is often?and problematically?taken for granted in classical tales: the heteronormative plot. French fairy-tale films provide a compelling area of study with respect to queer theory because of the existence of a genealogy of French queer directors?including Jean Cocteau, Jacques Demy, and Fran?ois Ozon?who have drawn from the fairy-tale genre to represent non-normative forms of sexuality. Although Catherine Breillat is not considered a queer director, her cinematic work fits broadly into the notion of queer in its subversion of normative forms of heterosexuality.</p>
   <p>Drawing on &ldquo;Hansel and Gretel&rdquo; (Ozon&rsquo;s?<em>Criminal Lovers</em>) and &ldquo;Sleeping Beauty&rdquo; (Breillat&rsquo;s?<em>Sleeping Beauty</em>), Ozon and Breillat queer the fairy tale in at least three ways. First, their films destabilize normative gender roles, either emphasizing the implicit complexity or challenging the normative representation of gender in the source tale. Second, just as characters move between masculinity and femininity, characters also drift between heterosexual and homosexual relations, challenging clear delineations between gay and straight. Third, through the staging of the main character&rsquo;s sexual initiation, both films suggest that the &ldquo;climax&rdquo; of the heteronormative fairy-tale plot may not, in the end, be all that it is cut out to be. Both films simultaneously challenge the classical heteronormative tale and generate new, queer fairy-tale forms.</p>

     <b>Abstract:</b> Subverting Gayle Rubin&rsquo;s seminal idea of &ldquo;traffic in women,&rdquo; this paper uses examples where male characters dress as women in order to gain control of their inheritances and incomes to show that there may be some conditional power and benefit in the position of the trafficked female, especially when the position is temporary.??In these instances, which include Thomas Middleton&rsquo;s?<em>A Mad World, My Masters</em>, Barnabe Riche&rsquo;s prose &ldquo;Phylotus and Emelia,&rdquo; and Ben Jonson&rsquo;s?<em>Epicoene</em>, a male-to-female (MTF) crossdresser intentionally enters him/herself into the marriage market, often replacing a cisgender woman who is herself unwilling to enter an arranged marriage plan.??In doing so, MTF crossdressers queerly cultivate and exploit the gendered relationships between parents and children and interrupt the normative relationships between male property holders interested in solidifying their relationships through kinship bonds. When MTF crossdressers market themselves as brides, they gain intimacy and access to financial and cultural stakeholders that they otherwise would not have. Further, these episodes demonstrate the competition, comparison, and occasional cooperation between genderqueer MTF crossdressers and the cisgender women whom they replace. MTF brides therefore demonstrate a form of &ldquo;relational gender&rdquo; that is deployed not only between the crossdresser and his/her target husband, but also between the crossdresser and the company of women that he enters in order to execute his/her plan.</p>

     <b> Sociology, Assistant Professor. <em>Arbitrary practices? Flexible work arrangements and supervisor influence in Detroit Metro manufacturing companies</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> Economic shifts have restructured workplaces in ways that fundamentally alter employee work experiences. Greater demands at work put more pressure on families, and in turn, work-family conflict can lead to high turnover, burnout, and job-related stress. Businesses are reexamining workplace conditions to accommodate working families, but policies and practices are still implemented in a market-driven model to maintain efficiency, productivity, and profit. The purpose of this paper is to explore flexible work arrangements within the context of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; economy. Using in-depth, qualitative interviews with employees in professional, managerial, and executive level positions, I find that tension remains between the intent to mitigate work-family conflict and the ever-present standards of the &ldquo;ideal worker norm&rdquo; ? long hours, visibility, and work before family. Employee narratives show how policies/practices are often uneven and arbitrary, revealing the consequences of gendered work expectations for both women?<em>and</em>?men.</p>

     <b> Library Science, Education Librarian; Library Science, Librarian IV. <em>Alice's Adventures in wonderland: A History of the Wayne State Libraries Special Collections Through a Children's Book</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> The Wayne State University Libraries house over a dozen special collections, containing rare treasures and noteworthy literary works. Using the children's tale?<em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,?</em>originallyauthored by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1865, Librarians Veronica Bielat and Cindy Krolikowski will take you on a tour through the history and holdings of several special collections in the Wayne State library system, exploring rare volumes and special editions contained in the collections. They will also discuss the history of the?<em>Eloise Ramsey Collection of Literature for Young People</em>, and highlight other collections situated in the Purdy Library Juvenile Collections. The presentation will close with examples of how these collections have been recently used for teaching, research and scholarship, and guidance on how faculty, students and community members may access and use the materials in these unique collections.</p>

            <b> CLAS, Information Management Specialist.<em> Lessons Learned by a Novice Lexicographer in Creating an e-Dictionary for the Episcopal Church</em></b><br />
            <b>Abstract: </b>My interest in Episcopal dictionaries stems from a conversation with a friend at church who said &quot;Let's meet at the narthex&quot; after the service. Not knowing what a narthex is, I asked him where that was. Shortly after that, I came across two Episcopal dictionaries in the church bookshop ? <em>Anglican Young People's Dictionary</em>?(June A. English, 2004) and?<em>A Dictionary for Episcopalians</em>?(revised edition, John N. Wall, 2000). I bought both and read them cover to cover. While I found them very interesting and useful, I was frustrated that neither were then available in electronic form. Thus in 2012 I began to collect Episcopal and Anglican dictionaries with the goal of producing a free electronic version of an Episcopal dictionary. My goal is to produce an e-book edition using the ePub format along with a web based version that will be searchable and include photos.??The e-book edition will include cross-references to other terms ? something recently released e-book versions of the previously mentioned dictionaries do not have. The web site will include audio pronunciation of words, photos, and video clips of activities ? such as clergy vesting themselves??My presentation will give an overview of my project, outline what still needs to be done, and provide a list of lessons learned by a novice lexicographer in creating an e-Dictionary for the Episcopal Church.</p>

     <b>CMLLC, Professor; Astronomy, Undergrad Research Assistant. <em>&quot;Zodiac and Design: Understanding Cass Gilbert and the Third Floor Loggia at the Detroit Public Library&quot;</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract: </b>The concept of the zodiac was found throughout the ancient world from Greece to Babylon to India, and designs featuring the zodiac can be found in floor and ceiling decorations of the ancient architecture of multiple cultures. As neoclassical architecture maintained popularity from the 18th?into the 20th?century, we continue to see examples of the zodiac being used in modern buildings.? One architect who seemed particularly fond of this motif was Cass Gilbert (1859-1934).? Gilbert used zodiac motifs in several of his designs such as the capitol building in St. Paul, Minnesota, the St. Louis Public library in Missouri, and closer to home, the main branch of the Detroit Public Library (1921).? Gilbert incorporated a zodiac motif in the extended tile floor of the loggia on the 3rd floor of the library. This paper will detail the design elements of Gilbert's zodiac, describing the materials used in its construction and the artistic composition of the design.? This paper will also compare the DPL zodiac to classical designs as well as zodiac motifs done in other Gilbert buildings.</p>

     <b>Political Science, Associate Professor.<em> When did economic performance matter for the political fortunes of China's provincial leaders?</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract: </b>Despite the conventional wisdom extolling the role of yardstick competition in China's post-1978 political economy, it is still not clear whether promoting local economic growth has bestowed career advantages on the provincial leaders. We first identify the major problems that have prevented the existing research from appropriately assessing the relevance of the yardstick competition thesis to China. By developing more precise measures of the political fortunes and economic performance records of the officials and highlighting China's political and institutional contexts during the reform era, we analyze how provincial economic performance affected the career outcomes of the provincial leaders during 1979-2005, the longest post-1978 period for which consistent provincial GDP data are available. We find that career dividends for faster economic performance did accrue to the provincial chief executives after the emergence of a national policy consensus behind the growth imperative in 1992, but not to the top provincial political leaders throughout this period.</p>

     <b> English, Associate Professor.<em> Low &amp; plain stile: Poetry and Piety in Early Modern English Benedictine Convents</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract: </b>According to her obituary, Clare Vaughan (d. 1687) of the Pontoise Benedictines was &ldquo;powrefull in words&rdquo; and converted several English soldiers to Catholicism.??Despite this rhetorical prowess, Vaughan conscientiously used plain language in her written meditations, &ldquo;taking care not to give them any other flourish or advantage, than what proceeded from holy simplicity.&rdquo;??This &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; neatly illustrates how monastic writing challenges our most basic assumption about literary achievement: that literature should be aesthetically accomplished.??This idea underpins the canon of early modern women writers, which foregrounds works demonstrating literary sophistication and witty creativity: the poetry, plays, and romances of women such as Aemilia Lanyer, Mary Sidney Herbert, Mary Wroth, and Margaret Cavendish.??This talk will expand the boundaries of that canon by considering the literary implications of poetry written by and for English Benedictine convents on the Continent.??Analysis of this poetry reveals that the English cloisters created alternative and particularized literary systems, developing monastic modes and styles at odds with the secular literary system in which other women writers worked.??As I hope to show, the English Benedictine convents consequently offer new literary paradigms that can complicate our current understanding of early modern women writers.</p>

     <b>English, Distinguished Professor.<em>  Coleridge and the Rhetoric of Slavery</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> Much critical attention has been directed to Coleridge&rsquo;s writing and slavery?the slave trade, slave trade abolition, slavery abolition?but I want to explore how his rhetoric of enslavement works.??If we, after William Empson, Debbie Lee, et alia, include the allegorical and subtextual references to slavery in poems like?<em>The Ancient Mariner</em>, Coleridge&rsquo;s writing then also refers explicitly to legal enslavement and to what we me might call metaphysical enslavement.??The latter rhetoric of slavery is evident in &ldquo;France.??An Ode,&rdquo; where the French revolutionaries are &ldquo;Slaves,&rdquo; and in various prose works where Coleridge refers to the will as being enslaved.??As he came to separate himself from the empiricist tradition of Hartley, he figured and maligned a philosophical tradition?materialist, Necessitarian, Spinozist?as enslaving the will, as advocates for false beliefs with dire moral and spiritual consequences.??What is literal, what figurative???Or do we follow Jerome Christiansen in seeing the operation of chiasmus:??physical slavery is to metaphysical, as metaphysical is to physical.??Is the metaphysical slavery simply hyperbolic figuration???After Patrick Keane&rsquo;s account of Coleridge&rsquo;s writing on slavery, it seems that Coleridge&rsquo;s conception of duty and rights gives so much weight to spiritual and moral agency that one cannot assume confidently that legal, physical enslavement of persons has priority over more metaphysical meanings of slavery.??Other factors include Coleridge&rsquo;s own drug addiction, his embodied experience of being compelled to do something his will could not control, and the physical abuse he suffered at school.</p>

     <b>Professor;  Professor, English and Linguistics.<em> &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;: The Significance of Four-Word Coordinative Expressions Across Languages</em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> In the study of syntax, there is an almost exclusive preoccupation with asymmetry and hierarchy: phrases have &ldquo;heads&rdquo; that dominate other words in the phrase, and these phrases are in turn dominated by phrases built above them. But constructions such as?<em>Like father, like son</em>, in which elements are simply juxtaposed, are also found in all human languages, albeit in some languages more than others. In this talk we explore the communicative and creative potential of such flat structures, with an emphasis on the commonplace yet expressive four-word coordinative constructions of the Hmong language of Southeast Asia.? Although such constructions are not capable of conveying certain things, they are remarkably evocative: without the rigid grammatical signposts characteristic of hierarchical syntax, flat structures allow room for hearers to draw on their imaginations</p>
