<div class="titles">Theme: Survival</div>
<p>Each year the Humanities Center sponsors a Faculty Fellowship Competition on a specific theme. This year's theme was &quot;Survival&quot;. Fellowships provide Wayne State University faculty with funding to help pay for expenses related to their research projects, including travel, research assistance, summer salary and fringe benefits. Fellowships average $6,000 and recipients are expected to participate in the annual Faculty Fellows' Conference held the following spring. Below is the explication of the theme, followed by brief descriptions of the projects that were selected for funding for the 2014-2015 academic year.</p>

<div id="text">
 <p>After the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species made the notion of survival widely known, it was extended to the social sphere in ethically and scientifically untenable ways as Social Darwinism, a concept that seems to continue at least latently in contemporary politico-economic thought that advocates minimal government interference with the market. The notion of survival has also been employed by philologists and linguistic anthropologists to discuss endangered languages as well as the development of phonetic and structural patterns in language generally in the context of historical linguistics. As archeologists traditionally explore physical traces of extinct cultures to reconstruct the latter based on their interpretations of the former, they deal in surviving remnants. Even the canon debates of literary scholars could be conceptualized in terms of survival as they concern which texts ought to become part of and remain in an imagined community's collective memory and thus survive not only in their physical form as books in libraries but also and especially that they are being read and discussed. After all, only those books that are read have the potential to impact a society's collective memory. Furthermore, archives and libraries are inherently concerned with the survival of their vast collections, i.e., the preservation of the physical matter from the brittle paper of illuminated manuscripts and folios to the constantly necessary transfer of electronic data to the most current modes of storage. Museums likewise seek to slow down the inevitable process of forgetting and thus to insure the survival of objects deemed valuable in a particular time and place by preserving them. To return again to the field of literature, survival has been a core subject in literary texts ranging from Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe and the many Robinsonades it inspired to autobiographical and fictional accounts of slavery and accounts of Holocaust survival by writers like Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi. Moreover, such core American figures as the frontier hero and the self-made man that have been depicted in countless variations in both canonical and popular literature as well as television and cinema engage in struggles for their physical and economic survival that at times revives the ruthless ethics of Social Darwinism. More recently, the notion of survival and the figure of the survivor and the subject of survival became ubiquitous in American popular culture. The mass media representation of survival includes: TV Reality Shows like Survivor, post-apocalyptic cinema and disaster movies generally, interactive online video games, the populist feminism practiced on daytime TV talk shows like Oprah, and most of all self-help literature which advises anyone from housewives to CEOs how to best survive the slings and arrows of everyday life in late capitalism.</p>
 <p><br />
   We are looking for proposals that examine &quot;Survival&quot; from a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary, humanistic and artistic perspectives. We anticipate that scholar's working in literature, law, political science, history, sociology, anthropology, art, languages, and other disciplines would find this topic appealing.</p>

  <p><strong>Title: The Survival of the Humanities in the Age of the Corporate University<br />
</strong>Paul Jay, Professor, English, Loyola University</p>
<p>The humanities have always had a kind of paradoxical position in higher education. Perceived as a central pillar of the liberal arts -- which are unthinkable without them -- they have nevertheless been in a nearly perpetual state of crisis, dogged by questions about both their practical value and their intellectual rigor. Now, at a time when students, their parents, and state legislators increasingly envision higher education as vocational training, a form of credentialing in which the value of courses and programs are defined narrowly in terms of how they will prepare students for jobs, the very survival of the humanities seems to be in question. This dramatic shift in views about the purpose of higher education has developed at a time when both taxpayers and legislators have dramatically cut back their economic support for higher education, and when the corporatization of higher education is accelerating. While these developments threaten the viability of a liberal arts education everywhere, they represent a more dire threat to the humanities, which are particularly vulnerable in an age of shrinking budgets and the expanding dominance of an educational ideal that puts a stress on computational, technological, and mechanical skills at the expense of a broad-based education in history, philosophy, and the arts. If the value of education is increasingly being measured by trustees and legislators too ready to replace a liberal arts model of higher education with a vocational training model of higher education, then it's no wonder the humanities seem to be in crisis. </p>
<p>
In the face of these changes, we need to develop a strategy that insures the humanities not only survive, but continue to play a central role in higher education. However, we can't do that without developing a coherent and contemporary explanation of what the humanities are  now, and what value their study has for 21st century students. I believe the survival of the humanities depends upon our ability to describe what they're about in a way that balances tradition with innovation and knowledge with skills. That survival cannot depend solely on the curation of a static or ossified version of the humanities based on preservation alone, a narrow insistence on the importance of historical, philosophical, and cultural knowledge for its own sake. It will depend as well on our stressing innovation, on our ability to develop a clear explanation of the positive, constructive role new subject areas, theories, and methodologies have played in diversifying, broadening, and updating our understanding of what it means to be human. We need to stress not just the historical and cultural knowledge humanities students gain ? as valuable as that is ? but also how, in learning to deal with the aesthetic, abstract, historical, and affective aspects of human experience they develop a set of skills, competencies, and dispositions that are broadly transferable no matter what they choose to do when they graduate. We also need to find ways to make the nature and value of our research and scholarship clear to people outside of the academy. While those who argue the humanities are thriving in the public sphere may be correct, that won't continue unless they continue to be nurtured by new and innovative research and scholarship in the academic sphere as well. An engaged, public humanities depends upon a vital and well-funded academic humanities to sustain it.

     <p><b>From Survival to Sustainability: Community-Based Pathways for Urban Arts Institutions</b><br />
    Alisa Moldavanova - Assistant Professor, Political Science<br />
  <br />
    This paper approaches organizational sustainability as a two-level concept that includes both institutional survival, as a baseline for sustainability, and longer-term sustainability, understood as the ability of institutions to persist and fulfill their public purpose in the long run. The paper argues that the sustainability of public and nonprofit arts organizations depends on the ability of these organizations to effectively connect with their communities, as well as on their ability to engage in collaborative governance with other actors. The paper presents preliminary observations regarding the role of organizational relationships for institutional sustainability, based on pilot interviews conducted with several cultural organizations located in the Detroit Metropolitan Area.

    <b>Just Food and Survival: The Moral Economy of Detroit's Gardens and Grocery Stores</b><br />
Andrew Newman - Assistant Professor, Anthropology

<p>In recent years popular and scholarly narratives about Detroit have become suffused with the language and imagery of mortality and organicism. Life, death, and rebirth have now emerged as well-worn master tropes, framing a veritable Detroit-genre of documentary films, media coverage, and research. It is therefore fitting that in this particular moment, food--the most basic element of human sustenance and survival--has emerged as an important object of contestation, at a tangible and symbolic level, for a variety of actors including politicians, business leaders, activists, as well as everyday Detroiters. This presentation aims to rethink contemporary Detroit through the lens of E.P. Thompson&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral economy&rdquo; concept, a construct that is more often associated with scholarship on peasant revolts in agrarian societies than urban politics in the contemporary U.S. It argues that unearthing the moral economy of Detroit&rsquo;s gardens and grocery stores provides a new lens on contestation over Detroit&rsquo;s future by linking the spheres of food, survival, and the re-imagining of right and wrong in the Motor City.</p>

    <b>"Born in Haiti! No Grave Can Hold Him!" Voodoo's Survival in Marvel's Zombie Comics of the 1970s</b>
<br />
Chera Kee - Assistant Professor, English
<p>In a 1973 issue of the comic Tales of the Zombie, a short article tells readers that Marvel is well aware of the newest craze sweeping the nation?voodoo?and the company has responded not only with Tales of the Zombie, and its troubled anti-hero Simon Garth, but also a brand-new hero by the name of Jericho Drumm. Unlike the contemporary crop of black heroes populating Marvel comics in the early 1970s, Drumm is different. He is a college-educated hero from Haiti. Having left his family and home culture to practice psychology in the U.S., Drumm must reconnect with his voodoo beliefs to avenge his brother's death as he becomes Brother Voodoo. In many ways taking advantage of the same blaxploitation strategies as filmmakers of the time, Marvel wedded a growing interest in voodoo with the need for a strong black hero to entice African-American readership.</p>
<p>
  At the same time Brother Voodoo was leaping off the pages, Simon Garth, The Zombie, was making a comeback. His first appearance was in a stand-alone horror story in 1953's Menace, but The Zombie's 1973 make-over didn't radically change the character.
  Rather, The Zombie remained a man killed and zombified by a former employee who spends his time trying to fight his masters and protect his living daughter. Yet, like Brother Voodoo, Tales of the Zombie also capitalized on the &quot;voodoo craze&quot; sweeping the nation, and as such, both titles were part of an attempt to recast voodoo as an empowering force for marginalized groups battling systemic racism, economic inequality, and cultural prejudices in their quests for survival.</p>
<p>
  It should be no surprise, then, that Marvel's take on voodoo in these titles?while still capitalizing on ideas of it as exotic, foreign, and mysterious?was far more respectful than earlier manifestations of voodoo in U.S. media, even more so than what Marvel itself had previously penned. These comics revolve around the survival of family and culture, and this is played out in spaces where syncretic borrowing is a necessity. Both heroes must make a pilgrimage to Haiti, and both must also align with Voodooists who are using the powerful religion for good. Both Garth and Drumm must expand their world views and accept the power of voodoo if they are to survive. Thus, in opening up Haiti as a space for heroes and voodoo as a force for good, Marvel was not so much reimagining the superheroes themselves but restructuring the cultures in which these heroes are expected to operate.</p>

    <b>The Jungle Out There: Gender, Danger, and Survival in the American Workplace</b><br />
 Elizabeth Faue - Professor, History

    <p>The  workplace, where we spend nearly half our waking hours, is a major site of  interpersonal conflict in contemporary society and a location where risk  includes toxic human interaction and even physical danger.? Once used as a metaphor for heated economic  competition, &ldquo;the Workplace Jungle&rdquo; suggests our pervasive and unfettered  anxiety and fear for personal safety at work.?  From &ldquo;mobbing&rdquo; and workplace bullying, to sexual harassment and &ldquo;going  postal,&rdquo; work has become an arena in which the act of earning a living can lead  to dying, either by slow physiological and psychological deterioration or by  the speed of a bullet.?? This project  focuses on feminism and the narratives and language of workplace survival.? It examines the relatively recent &ldquo;epidemic  of workplace bullying&rdquo; and its consequences in terms of well-being (the erosion  of individual workers&rsquo; health) and safety (the rise in workplace violence) in  historical context and analyzes the language and metaphors in which we now view  the workplace, work, and individual work careers.</p>

    <b>Survival of Older Immigrant Languages in Detroit: The Case of German</b> <br />
Felecia Lucht - Assistant Professor, CMLLC<br />
<br />
This presentation examines evidence of the survival of German in  Metro Detroit from the early/mid-19th century to today through a  diachronic study of language use in key domains of community life,  including: the home, the workplace, the  press, as well as educational and religious institutions.? I will draw upon the continuing research from  my Detroit Germans project, as well as information from the digital stories by <a class="normalA" href="http://www.fltc.wayne.edu/eld/">Ethnic Layers of Detroit research group</a> and through our NEH  funded project, Ethnic Layers of Detroit: Experiencing Place through Digital  Storytelling.? What will be shown in the  presentation is that while German is no longer a dominant community language in  Metro Detroit, it still &lsquo;survives&rsquo; today in other ways, including symbolic use  (such as the annual German-language Christmas service at Historic Trinity  Lutheran Church on Gratiot Avenue), in print (the <em>Nordamerikanische Wochen-Post</em> which has been in publication for  approximately 160 years) as well as through events sponsored by cultural  organizations like the Carpathia Club of Sterling Heights.</div>

<b>Writing Communities: Textual Production and Spiritual Identity in Early Modern English Benedictine Convents, 1600-1800</b><br />
Jaime Goodrich - Assistant Professor, English<br />
<br />
After Catholicism became illegal in England in 1558, Englishwomen established dozens of convents on the Continent that served as vital centers of Catholic spirituality.  The Brussels Benedictines were the first Continental convent founded for Englishwomen after the Reformation, and the house initially enjoyed great prestige due to its piety and its association with prominent Jesuit priests.  However, when Abbess Mary Percy began to limit the convent's access to these Jesuit confessors, a series of controversies ensued over spiritual governance that culminated in a major threat to the community's survival: a dramatic lawsuit lodged against Percy in Rome, accusing her of murder, financial impropriety, and misgovernance.  The cultural, political, and religious significance of these disputes is evident from the massive, but largely unknown, corpus of extant manuscripts produced by the nuns, their friends and relatives, and ecclesiastical officials: over 1,000 texts in English, French, Latin, Dutch, and Italian scattered across multiple archives in England, Belgium, and Italy.  Focusing on my archival research at the Vatican Library and Archives of Propaganda Fide, this paper discusses two interrelated topics: 1) the historical circumstances that have shaped the survival of evidence documenting these quarrels; 2) the narrative strategies that Percy used to ensure the survival of her convent. <br />

    <b>After the Century of Struggle: African-American Women and Disfranchisement after the 19th Amendment, 1920-1945</b> <br />Liette Gidlow - Associate Professor, History<br />
<br /><p>
  "After the 'Century of Struggle'" offers a radical reinterpretation of the woman suffrage amendment, the measure long credited for the single greatest expansion of democracy in U.S. history.  </p>
<p>
The prevailing scholarship understands the Nineteenth Amendment as the triumphant end of a struggle that began in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York.  Professor Gidlow's research, however, indicates that a great many African American women remained in effect disfranchised for decades as opponents used Jim Crow tactics, poll taxes, and violence to drive these women from the polls. Though the Nineteenth Amendment officially granted women the right to vote in 1920, it took continued struggle and mobilization, often in partnership with men and through diverse institutions such as churches, civic groups, sororities, before many African American women were able to freely cast ballots.</p>
<p>
This research advances historical scholarship in important ways. It identifies the failure of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to secure the franchise for African American men after the Civil War as a prelude to the failure of the Nineteenth Amendment to enfranchise women of color. It connects the woman suffrage movement to the freedom movements of the mid-twentieth centiury. Finally, it offers a more balanced interpretation of the woman suffrage amendment that weighs its successes against its failures.<br/>(<a class="normalA" href="https://youtu.be/ocb2j_fO6lc" target="_new">Video</a>)</p>

   <b>Communicative Complexities of Integrated Artic Management</b><br />
Rahul Mitra - Assistant Professor, Communication <br />

  <br />
  Faced by the stark realities of climate change in its Arctic region, the United States recently proposed a comprehensive &ldquo;Integrated Arctic Management&rdquo; (IAM) framework for the management of environmental resources and human development. The IAM seeks to: 1) adopt a &ldquo;whole-of-government&rdquo; approach to Arctic development, rather than leave different agencies vying with each other; 2) organize meaningful conversations among stakeholders, including the state of Alaska, native governments and companies, and corporations operating in the area; and, 3) promote &ldquo;science-based decision-making&rdquo; while communicating its outcomes effectively to policymakers. Communication is an essential part of implementing the IAM successfully, in terms of building productive collaborations among stakeholders, deliberating political and economic policy, and designing effective messages for broader publics (ION, 2012). This research project examines, through a Visiting Fellowship with Anchorage-based research and policy nonprofit organization, Institute of the North (ION), how organizations on the ground in Alaska?government agencies, civic bodies, nonprofits, and corporations?are working toward implementing the IAM.<br/>(<a class="normalA" href="http://youtu.be/_xuqiZ6dQyA" target="_new">Video</a>)<br />

    <b>Surviving in Detroit: Men Experiencing Homelessness due to Death of a Parent</b><br />Tam E. Perry - Assistant Professor, Social Work <br />

<br />
  Researchers estimate that since 1999, when the number of  homeless older adults in the United States was an estimated 120,000, over the  next three decades this number could rise to 800,000 based on the large  population of aging adults (McDonald et. al, 2008). Thus, in Detroit and around  the country, more older adults are experiencing homelessness, some newly  homeless and others chronically. For the newly homeless, research indicates  that it occurs due to a combination of vulnerability factors and a trigger  event, often an eviction, death of a spouse or divorce, retirement and the loss  of income (McDonald et. al, 2008). The purpose of this study is to gain insight  and perspective on the experiences of older adult men who suffered homelessness  after losing a parent or parental figure. For this presentation, researchers  analyze qualitative interviews from five homeless recovery service providers to  better understand the survival of these men. This study is a collaborative  project with Neighborhood Service Organization, and is presented by Dr. Tam  Perry, Ph.D. and Assistant Professor in the School of Social Work, and  co-presented by Luke Hassevoort, MSW Graduate Research Assistant, and Justin Petrusak, BSW,  LMSW, QMHP, and Clinical Supervisor at Neighborhood Service Organization's Tumaini Center. <br />(<a class="normalA" href="http://youtu.be/AjzOp8nlqcw" target="_new">Video</a>)
