<h3>Explication</h3>
<div id="text">
  <p align="justify">&quot;The unexamined life is not worth living.&quot; With these words, Socrates <br />
    famously explained his decision to choose death over exile or silence after he had been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens. Socrates' quest to understand the good life helped establish the Western philosophical tradition, and his life and death pose questions that still resonate today. The good life?it is what we all want, but what is it exactly? Is it food on our plate, swinging from a hammock on the beach, or personal fulfillment from spirituality or work?  How can we recognize it, and how can we find it? What happens when different ideas of the good life collide?</p>
  <p align="justify"> Since Socrates' death over two thousand years ago, influential thinkers from Cicero to Montaigne have sought to identify the good life.  Augustine, Aquinas, and other theologians have viewed the good life from a religious perspective, and political theorists and leaders like Vladimir Lenin, Ronald Reagan, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau promised a good life after radical economic change. Meanwhile, authors from Thomas More and Jonathan Swift to Margaret Atwood and Suzanne Collins have imagined utopian and dystopian societies that satirize our inability to achieve the good life. While musicians like Pharrell Williams and Bobby McFerrin have encouraged us to be happy and Men at Work boasted of their land of plenty, other musicians from Tony Bennett to Weezer take more pessimistic views of the good life as sugarcoating our personal deficiencies. Social psychologists have argued that the modern quest for material things never leads to the good life, and cultural anthropologists like George Foster posited that peasants believed in a world of limited good. </p>
  <p align="justify"> The good life also connects the humanities and sciences. Disciplines such as medicine, psychology, and the life sciences seek to ensure health (both mental and physical) by understanding and preventing disease. The intersection of these two senses of the good life?as a scientific and philosophical enterprise?has recently led to the creation of interdisciplinary fields (the medical humanities, medical ethics and bioethics, and the philosophy of healthcare) that seek to answer pressing questions: What is the ethical basis of medical research?  How does the moral obligation of the doctor relate to the rights of a patient?&quot;</p>

  <h3>Keynote/Abstract </h3>
  <div id="text">
  <p><strong>Robert Kurzban<br />
University of Pennsylvania</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Willpower-What it is, What it isn't, and What it's For</em></strong>  </p>
  <p>Why  is it so difficult to exercise willpower? A leading explanation among  psychologists is that there is a physical resource in your brain ? the fuel for  willpower ? that is depleted over time. As this resource is consumed, it  becomes harder and harder to resist temptation. However, a growing body of  evidence suggests that, as compelling as this explanation might be, there are  very good reasons to doubt it. Instead, I'll suggest that failures of willpower  are better thought of in the context of motivation. Specifically, the reason  that it is difficult to persist on effortful tasks is that our brains are  continuously entertaining the possibility of switching to another task that is  likely to be psychologically rewarding. Put more technically, engaging in  effortful tasks carries the <em>opportunity  cost</em> of not engaging in a more pleasurable task. These costs, I'll suggest,  are at the heart of why it is difficult to exercise willpower. I'll conclude  with the question of why our brains are wired this way, and how we can use this  knowledge to live the sort of lives we would like to. </p>

    <strong><em>The Good Life: Creative Action for Health  and Happiness</em><em></em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Holly Feen- Calligan<br />
          Wayne State University</b></p>
        <p>As artists and social activists we  propose that the &ldquo;good life&rdquo; is one anchored in art, service, reflection and  self-care. We refer to authors from the arts and humanities including Jane  Addams, Saul Alinski, Grace Lee and James Boggs, Ellen Dissanayake, Josef  Garai, bell hooks, Miles Horton, Jeff Howard, Edith Kramer, Richard Sennett, Gail  Straub, Marianne Williamson and others to support our hypothesis that the responsibilities  and demands of present-day living result in a sense of emptiness, isolation and  disconnection from others and the earth.&nbsp; We argue that the methods of  creative production and the process of making?observation and visualization;  touch and feel; handwork and craft, human-material interaction; experimentation  and reflection?lead us to empirical truths about ourselves, our relationships  to one another and to the natural world (including animals, plants, organic and  in-organic materials). In essence, creative practice serves to counteract  loneliness and social detachment and&nbsp;contributes to a sense of  satisfaction, purpose and pleasure; creative practice contributes to the good  life. </p>
        <p>In this presentation we explore the  transformative qualities of art- making for individuals, and art making  in a social context. We point to the value of art in the lives of individuals,  while emphasizing that the health of individuals and the health of the world  are intertwined: Through compassionate care for ourselves and others the good  life is created together. In this presentation we share examples from the ways  that we are working within our classes through art-based service-learning, community  collaboration, design interventions and in-class fellowship and support. Our collective  efforts comprise conscious participatory  citizenship and other tools needed for the future.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/wsuhumanitiescenter/albums/72157662339878526" target="_blank">Photos</a> -  <a href="https://youtu.be/RKvSp-bjEkY" target="_blank">Video</a></p>

    <p><strong><em>Women as Artisans, Women as Entrepreneurs: A Fractured Vision of the &quot;Good Life&quot;</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Denise Vultee<br /> 
          Wayne State University
</b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>The handmade  movement and the trend toward entrepreneurship often meet in the form of small  businesses run by artisans?predominantly women?who aspire to make a living selling  their handmade goods.  On the global  level, numerous special projects promote the revival of traditional handcrafts as  a route to economic independence for women in developing countries.  Yet the ideals and aspirations of artisans  and entrepreneurs?even when the two are embodied in the same individual?are  often at odds.  This paper uses symbolic  convergence theory and its associated method, fantasy theme analysis, to trace  the history of tensions between artisanal and entrepreneurial constructions of  the &quot;good life.&quot;  It then uses  the lens of feminist critical theory to interrogate this rhetorical vision in  the context of women's lives and work, both as artisans and as entrepreneurs. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Words As Hard As Cannon-Balls: Liberty of Speech and the Pursuit of Happiness in 19th-century America</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Sandra F. VanBurkleo<br />
          Wayne State University </b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>When we think of &lsquo;the good  life,&rsquo; as the symposium call for papers suggests, we think most often of  enjoyment, time away from public responsibility, perhaps the absence of intrusive  governments.  In the past, however, as  now, these phenomena were outcomes of extended, often wrenching processes of  change or development.  To take a  vacation, e.g, workers had to successfully prosecute an eight-hour  movement.  In a new book <em>(&ldquo;Words As Hard As Cannon-Balls&rdquo;:  American Experiences of Freedom of Speech in  the Long 19th Century)</em>,* I examine the ways in which disparate  Americans sought to contribute to civil society through written or spoken  speech ? to express themselves as citizens or, in some cases, as foreign  onlookers or aspirants to citizenship ? only to discover that access to the  forum, with many other incidents of a public personality, had been unevenly  distributed.  In some cases ? white  working men, for example, or black people or women of all classes ? the right  to speak alongside men therefore formed part of what Hendrik Hartog has called  constitutions of aspiration.  Without the  ability to participate in decisions that directly affected collective or  individual well-being, whether at home or elsewhere, the majority of Americans  hardly experienced what they themselves would have called happiness or  satisfaction.  Hence, thousands of  women&rsquo;s rights activists ? male, female, black, white ? pushed the boundaries  of acceptable public deportment for women; Maria Stewart dared to speak of and  denounce rape to mixed-sex audiences and in newspaper essays, in effect  announcing her legitimacy as social critic; Frances Harper, Sojourner Truth,  Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and a myriad of other, lesser known  figures did much the same thing.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Glimpses of Reagan-Era American Culture in the Songs of Billy Joel</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Joshua S. Duchan<br />
          Wayne State University </b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>American singer Billy  Joel (b. 1949, New York) has enjoyed a pop music career spanning twenty-two  years and including twelve albums, six Grammy awards and twenty-three  nominations, and a host of other honors. Despite a testy relationship with  critics?he was called &ldquo;vaudevillian&rdquo; and a &ldquo;lounge lizard&rdquo; whose performances  embodied not a pop aesthetic but one rooted in a &ldquo;Las Vegas format&rdquo;?his music  met with great commercial success, perhaps because of his keen ability, rooted  in the singer-songwriter mode in which his career began, to translate larger  cultural trends into compelling musical narratives.</p>
        <p><br />
          This paper provides a  close musical and semiotic reading of two of Joel&rsquo;s songs, &ldquo;Pressure&rdquo; (from <em>The Nylon Curtain</em>, 1982) and &ldquo;Running On Ice&rdquo; (from <em>The Bridge</em>, 1986), which express deep  anxieties of middle-class American life in the late twentieth century. In  &ldquo;Pressure,&rdquo; Joel dispenses advice to an unnamed, na?ve subject who relies on  faith, &ldquo;Peter Pan advice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;some cosmic rationale.&rdquo;  His vocal delivery borders on sinister, while  the musical accompaniment conveys a sense of certainty unlike any other track  on that album. In &ldquo;Running On Ice,&rdquo; Joel&rsquo;s character is more vulnerable,  expressing apprehension and bewilderment at the quickening pace of daily life and  shifting cultural values. The rapid keyboard lines are played on a cold,  metallic- sounding synthesizer, while percussion cuts through the musical  texture with machinelike precision.</p>
        <p><br />
          Through these two songs,  Joel reveals a world in which a generation?the baby boomers? has come of age  and recognized its cynicism and limitations. In this way, Joel&rsquo;s musical  portraits offer glimpses of moments of discovery, when the lofty promises of  the American dream&rsquo;s &ldquo;good life&rdquo; are shattered by Reagan-era realities.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The  Good Life' as a Form of Idolatry in the Modern World</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Jose Cuello<br />
          Wayne State University </b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>In this presentation, I posit the idea  that &ldquo;The Good Life&rdquo; is a term that best represents the worship of material  consumerism that has come to define the &ldquo;American way of life.&rdquo;  The massive advertising propaganda that  bombards our senses through every medium of communication constitutes a  national ideology of celebratory participation in the entertainment excesses of  modern post-industrial society.  Consumerism  has become a religion of personal acquisition of goods and experiences that can  never satisfy the mind or the spirit, leaving the everyday person to hunger for  even more.   The pursuit of material happiness has  ironically created the opposite condition of &ldquo;The Good Life&rdquo; for millions of  human beings.  It has led to massive debt  loads in credit cards, college loans, and home mortgages.  It has led to the destruction of communities,  families, individual psychologies and what otherwise would have been healthy  bodies were it not for the epidemics in obesity and diabetes.  The illusion that one can achieve &ldquo;better  living through chemistry&rdquo; (consumerism) has led humanity to the brink of  ecological disaster on our planetary home.   Perhaps, a common sense return to an appreciation of the value of  positive social relations, community-building, and doing more with less can  mitigate the impact of the impending apocalypse that the human species has  created for itself in pursuit of &ldquo;The Good Life.&rdquo; Appropriate statistics on  consumerism and its impact will be presented to support the Chicken Little  Thesis that the sky is falling.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Imagining and Living a Good Old Age in Postsocialist Poland</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Jessica Robbins-Ruszkowski<br />
          Wayne State University </b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>In contemporary Poland, dominant  cultural ideals of a good life in old age are  best represented by the  proliferation of educational institutions for older adults, or Universities of the Third Age (UTAs),  perhaps the most visible model of what gerontologists  alternately call &ldquo;successful,&rdquo; &ldquo;active,&rdquo; &ldquo;healthy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;productive&rdquo; aging.  Older Poles who participate in UTAs  often understand such experiences in political-economic and spatiotemporal terms; attending UTAs is associated with  living?and aging?in a world reshaped  by postsocialist transformations and European Union membership. &ldquo;Active aging&rdquo;  in Poland can thus be seen as a political practice through which older people aspire  to overcome stigma associated with the socialist past by striving for a European future. Certain activities  indexical of the new world order provide the most potential for older Poles to become what one  institutional leader has called &ldquo;Euroseniors.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>However, this dominant model may  work to reproduce forms of inequality. First,  this possible future is not equally available to everyone, as class and  health status limit participation in (and aspirations to) UTAs.  Second, this model&rsquo;s focus on the new (e.g.,  English, computers) ignores other &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; practices (e.g., embroidery, gardening, religious practices) through  which Poles achieve a worthy old age. In this paper, I draw on twenty-two months of ethnographic research to show that  similar practices of sociality and  relatedness occur among diverse groups of older Poles, demonstrating that moral personhood  is possible for older people who do not fit normative models. Therefore, a postsocialist  analytic framework is insufficient to fully understand the complexities of experiencing and imagining aging in  contemporary Poland. Using anthropological theories of personhood, kinship, and the  moral imagination, I argue that ethnographic attention to practices of sociality can  illuminate deeper histories that continue to  shape contemporary moral  imaginations of aging and of life itself.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Images of What Might Have Been and What Might Be in Life  Stories: Meaning Making, the Good Life, and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Joseph M Fitzgerald<br />
          Wayne State University </b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Two  significant developments in contemporary psychology are relevant to the study  of the images and memories of the good life. One is the realization that the  memory system can be conceptualized as a time travel system that allows us to  move not only back to past but forward to the future or back to a revised past.  We now apply methods previously reserved to the study of memories of the past  to images of what might have taken place in the past or what might take place  in the future. The other development has been a rediscovery of the important  role that meaning making plays in human happiness. The work of humanistic  psychologists especially Victor Frankel is framing large empirical studies. The  attention to meaning making draws together psychologists and humanists, so it  is not uncommon to see references to Augustine and neuroscientists such as  Daniel Schacter in the same paper.</p>
        <p>We will  discuss our approach to meaning making in the context of study of memories and  images of live stories reported by a diverse group of 175 adults aged 40 to 80.  The participants wrote four events along with their image of an event they  wished/hoped had happened in the past or will happen in the future. Consistent  with the conference theme, we focus our attention on the wished/hoped for  events. Our focal analyses concern the valence (positivity-negativity) of these  responses in relationship to other qualities of the descriptions including  specificity, coherence, primary theme, age, tension and emotionality, and centrality  of the event to identity. This approach generates large quantities of data, but  the confluence of methods reduces to a small number of idiographic and  normative patterns of meaning making that predict the well-being of the  individual.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Developing Human-Heartedness: A Confucian Conception of the Good Life</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Eun-Jung Katherine Kim<br />
          Wayne State University </b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do not seek life at the expense of human-heartedness <em>(ren)</em>.  Some even sacrifice their lives to complete  their <em>ren</em>&rdquo; (<em>Analects</em> XV, 8).  According to Confucius, a life without  human-heartedness is not worth living.  The  Chinese character <em>ren </em>? consists of &ldquo;human&rdquo; and &ldquo;two,&rdquo; and captures the human  characteristics that are conducive to flourishing human relationships.  This paper examines the moral and political  dimensions of <em>ren</em> by considering the  following questions:  What is the  fundamental basis of <em>ren</em>?  How does a person of <em>ren</em> resolve the conflict between love and justice?  What are the rules of propriety (<em>li</em>) and how do they constrain <em>ren</em>?  How does the ideal ruler display <em>ren</em>?  What are the political outcomes of ruling with <em>ren</em>?   By answering these questions, we will see that the Confucian virtue of <em>ren</em> is related to human <em>relations</em> and differs from Aristotle&rsquo;s  notion of virtue, which is human excellence with regard to human <em>function. </em></p>

    <p><strong><em>The  pleasure of telling/being told stories as a key for a happy life</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Jorgelina Corbatta<br />
          Wayne State University </b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Why  children like to be told stories over and over again? Why do we need to tell  stories to our beloved ones, and when in distressed it is advised to write our  own life story, to write a diary, to express ourselves? Why from the Greek  tragedy to contemporary films, novels and television shows, human beings have  the need to watch, listen and make narratives?</p>
        <p>After a  life of reading literature and watching movies, of telling and being told  narratives I have the conviction that those activities are important components  of a happy life. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore, through  different lenses, how creativity enriches our well being. One is Sigmund  Freud&rsquo;s contribution on creativity (&ldquo;The Relation of the Poet to Day Dreaming&rdquo;,  &ldquo;The Uncanny&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Theme of the Three Caskets&rdquo;, his studies on Leonardo and  Michelangelo, &ldquo;Beyond the Pleasure Principle&rdquo;); in addition I would like to  consider Peter Brook&rsquo;s rereading of Freud, and Lacan, in his famous &ldquo;Freud&rsquo;s  Master-plot&rdquo;  (<em>Reading for the Plot</em>), and in his exemplary study <em>Psychoanalysis</em> <em>and Storytelling.</em></p>
        <p>Brooks&rsquo;  interest, following Freud&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beyond the Pleasure Principle&rdquo; as <em>Master plot</em>, consists in superimposing  Freud&rsquo;s conception of the mind unto literature, also a product of the mind.  &ldquo;Psychoanalysis and literature?he says in an interview-- are mutually  illuminating: according to psychoanalysis, man is a fiction-making animal, one  defined by fantasies and fiction.&rdquo;  In  that direction human beings need, and enjoyed fiction, not only as an  re-enactment of children&rsquo;s play as wish fulfillment, equivalent to the  day-dreaming adult, but also because of their curative effect. By modifying the  Latin statement,  &ldquo;<em>Mens sana in corpore sano</em>&rdquo; by &ldquo;<em>Mens  sana in fabula sana</em>&rdquo;, Brooks establishes that the ability to narrate a  coherent life story is the representation of mental health. Also, from a  clinical point of view, contemporary studies demonstrate that a way of  obtaining happiness is writing about yourself (&ldquo;Writing Your Way to Happiness&rdquo;,  The New York Times, Tuesday January 20, 2015, D6). </p>

     <p><strong><em>What is the Best Sort of Life</em></strong></p>
        <p><b>Bruce Alan Russell<br />
          Wayne State University </b><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Socrates argued that the life of virtue is the best  sort of life.  His interlocutors asked  him about the just man who is thrown into prison, tortured, has his eyes burned  out, and is then impaled? Socrates had to say that this virtuous man was  happy.  Aristotle said that &ldquo;no one would  call [such a person] happy, unless he were maintaining a thesis at all  costs.&rdquo;  Happiness is an intrinsic good  but so is virtue. Perhaps the best life is one that combines the two. But what  if it is impossible to be both virtuous and happy?  Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;cool villain&rdquo; has reason in control  of his passions, as Plato and Aristotle required of their virtuous person, but  the villain uses reason to enrich himself at the expense of others. Why shouldn&rsquo;t  he if he will be much happier if he takes advantage of others than if he were  virtuous and did not?  The &ldquo;why be  moral?&rdquo; question was first posed by Plato in <em>The Republic </em>through the  story of the shepherd, Gyges, who found a magical gold ring that allowed him to  become invisible and then to steal and kill without fear of being caught.  I will argue that no one has been able to  meet the challenge that Kant&rsquo;s cool villain and the story of Gyges pose to  those who say it is always better, or more rational, for a person to act  morally than to do wrong, even if doing that requires a sacrifice of personal  happiness. </p>

        <p>This paper provides an informal and to some extent first-person account of the challenges facing journalists and public officials in Slovenia as they prepare for the successive waves of refugees who are arriving at the country's borders. The project first provides some background on Slovenia itself and the context of the first-person comments and interviews that inform the paper. The remainder of the project considers the specific ethical issues facing Slovenian journalists as they report on these events and the way the country's political  and NGO bureaucracies are trying to work through the problems the crisis has created. The paper contrasts the questions Slovenian journalists are confronting with  the reporting some US news outlets are doing on the refugee  issue.   It concludes with some analysis of how journalists frame human flourishing in this instance.<br />
