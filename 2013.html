<h3>Explication</h3>
<div id="text">
  
    <p>The search for Truth has been the symbolic theme and central object of most academic, intellectual, and spiritual enterprises. Whether or not we believe in "Objectivity," Truth keeps its imaginative hold and psychological power on us as scholars, critics, private individuals, and public citizens. We want to know the Truth; but as Colonel Jessup rebukes navy defense counsel Kaffee in A Few Good Men, we "can't handle the Truth." So what is the Truth and what role does it play in our public culture, our scholarly work, and our private lives? Many of us find the Truth, or our perception of it, inconvenient and not infrequently uncivil and inappropriate, even rude. We are discomforted by raw honesty but also taken aback by abject lying, willful deception, and blatant manipulation of the "Facts." And this obsession with Truth, and with its opposite--Lies, pervades our culture. Is it any wonder there's a new television program called "Deception," or that the presidential debates of 2012 were rife with accusations of lying and dishonesty? Or that Lies about money and its uses still haunt our descriptions of the recent banking crisis and economic downturn? Using Truth as a theme, scholars are invited to present papers on philosophical, literary, social, political, historical, and artistic representations of the Truth and the role Truth plays in our public culture and our everyday lives.</p>

  <p>Truth Telling in Radiation Oncology Clinic
The case study examined truth telling in a radiation oncology clinic using participant-observation methods. The clinic was located in a National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Center in a Southern state. The author followed a patient being treated for a rare form of lymphoma, who received 26 sessions of Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy (TSET). The radiation oncology clinic was observed for more than 100 hours between February and May 2012. The author observed the interactions in the clinic waiting room among patients, their significant others, and providers for 50 hours, participated in 12 doctor-patient encounters, and was a participant observer during a 30 hour In patient stay. While the side-effects of radiation treatment were listed on the informed consent form, the nature of the side-effects and their impact on patient well-being were not fully revealed. The paper examines the practice of partial truth-telling and its consequences for patients treated with radiation therapy.

   <strong><em>"Paltering vs Lying which is Worse?"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  Thomas M. Kelly<br />
Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p>?A lie involves three components; intent, literal meaning, and effect. A liar:(a) presents factually incorrect information with the intent to deceive; (b) communicates information that is literally untrue; and (c) produces the effect of having the listener believe that the false information is true. Conversely, if these three components are missing in a communication, the statement would be considered truthful. Many communications, however, fall somewhere between out right lying and truth telling. In these communications, an element of full blown lying is missing as well an element of truth telling. For example, if the intent component of a lie is missing, the speaker would be communicating a false statement he or she believes to be true. While such communications may be viewed as reckless or negligent (e.g. former President George W. Bush's claim of Sadaam Husain's nuclear arsenal), because they lack the element of intent they would likely not be viewed as lying or fraudulent. Within a legal context, when intent to deceive is absent, lying or fraud is missing as well. In another set of communications, the first and third components of lying (i.e. intent and achieved deception) are present, while the second component (i.e. the literal untruth of the communication) is relaxed. These communications bend, stretch, shade, slant, and distort the truth. However, they manage to fall short of outright lying. These in sincere, misleading, and deceptive communications have been referred to as palters, and their use has been called paltering.  The goal of the palterer and the liar is exactly the same ;to mislead or deceive the listener. However, the palterer's communication, unlike that of the liar, falls short of a literal falsehood or untruth. The palterer's message typically contains a "grain of truth" which keeps it short of a full blown lie. For example, a "struggling actress" was hired as an extra in a crowd scene of a major motion picture.

    <strong><em>"Truth In Exchange"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  Barry Lyons<br />
Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p> Different forms of exchange entail different characteristic stances toward truth and deception. My understanding of exchange builds on the Maussian tradition in anthropology, which distinguishes between reciprocal gift exchange embedded in social relationships and impersonal market exchange. Different relationships between communication and material transactions structure these two forms of exchange. Gift and market exchange also generate different conceptualizations of social actors and their obligations: in reciprocity, actors are persons enmeshed in ongoing mutual obligations that cannot be precisely, fully specified; in the market, they are autonomous agents who rely on (ideally) transparently communicated information about commodities and intentions in order to negotiate and enter into explicit commitments. In analyzing the differences in the communication surrounding gift and market exchange, I draw on Peircean semiotics and on work in linguistic pragmatics (and metapragmatics)?Grice's theory of implicature, speech-act theory, and linguistic and anthropological critiques of those theories' claims to universality. I will support the argument with a comparative ethnography of the role of truth and deception in Ecuadorian and U.S. child-rearing, relating differences in child-rearing to differences in the dominant ways people in each society conceive of agency, obligations, and relationships. Cross- culturally, the United States is an extreme case of the ideological dominance of market models even in conceptualizations of personal relationships, and concomitantly, of regard for a particular type of truthfulness?factual, "objective" truthfulness and faithful compliance with explicit commitments. Ecuadorian caregivers, by contrast, routinely deceive young children as part of preparing them for a social world in which sensitivity to others' needs and feelings far outrank that sort of truthfulness in the hierarchy of virtues.

    <strong><em>"Truth and Beauty: Aesthetic Novelty and the Priority of Feeling
"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  Renee C Hoogland<br />
Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p> In this paper I would like to explore the question of truth from a philosophical point of view  and argue that beauty ultimately takes precedence over truth. Drawing on Alfred North Whitehead's "theory of pure feeling," I will argue that truth may be compelling (and that this is, indeed, part of its beauty) but that aesthetic experience, the embodied, animal event of feeling, offers the only possibility for novelty, for change, and is thus the higher value in relation to truth. I will substantiate my claim that it is more important that a statement or thought is interesting than that it is true by drawing on various works of art photography--as a medium that has been beset from its invention by the contradictory pulls of the need to produce truth, to document, and the equally powerful urge to generate beautiful images.

    <strong><em>"The Relationship between Justice, Belief and Truth"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  Bruce Russell<br />
Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p> We might believe something because it is true, or, instead, because it makes us happy or feel good. Pascal is famous for having argued that we should believe in God because it pays, that is, because it is the best bet if we are hoping for eternal happiness. But others think that we should not believe in God because the evidence offered by the problem of evil counts against his existence. What is the relationship between evidence, truth, and justified belief? I will argue that when pragmatic considerations (about happiness, personal gain, an afterlife, etc.) are set aside, our aim when it comes to belief should be to believe something if, and only if, it's true. Justification, then, will consist in the responsible pursuit of truth, which amounts to fitting our beliefs to the evidence. We can have a justified false belief, say, if we are a member of a jury where the defendant has been cleverly framed, or even all of our justified beliefs could be false, as they would be if we were in The Matrix. Conversely, our unjustified beliefs might be true, as would happen if we luckily guessed the correct number of jelly beans in a jar. I will argue that justified or rational beliefs are those that fit the evidence we possess because justification involves responsible pursuit of the truth, and that involves fitting our beliefs to the evidence.

    <strong><em>"Why is Truth is Stranger than Fiction"</em></strong><br />

   <p> The principle of "migo" in Talmudic law provides that a claimant or witness who tells an improbable story is nevertheless to be believed when he or she could have told a false, but credible story that would have been more effective under the circumstances. The constructedness both of perception and of knowledge escapes our everyday attention as we proceed in a common cultural world where truth and reality?no less than language?seem transparent and self-evident. Typically, it is only when the taken-for-granted is challenged by failure, conflict, or competing cultural understandings that the artifactual quality of "reality" becomes salient. But colloquial expressions such as "truth is stranger than fiction" and "you can't make stuff like that up" testify to a residual awareness of the world as recalcitrant to our constructions. We hold steadfastly to those constructions nonetheless because, to paraphrase Philip Roth, the conventions that shape everything, large and small, serve as barriers against the improbabilities and disruptions of life. But this illusion of comfort is a form of denial that comes at a significant price. For as much as it allays our fears of chaos and, ultimately, mortality, it also conceals and therefore makes possible forms of authority and practices of oppression that elude our moral comprehension and condemnation. Our constructions often enlighten; but they also deceive. They persuade; but they also mislead. Nowhere is this more evident than in law where, with the right framing, a legal proposition can be made to say many different things.</p>

   <p> This session will examine the rhetoric used by proponents of educational reform and how they use of online learning (i.e., cyber schooling, virtual schooling, etc.) as a solution for K-12 education. The solution proposed by these proponents is often the dramatic and unregulated expansion of for profit K-12 online learning options. Using the research into K-12 online learning, I will argue that those educational reformers use methodologically flawed research or promote  an inaccurate understanding of research results to promote a corporate agenda in K-12 online learning. Finally, I will examine the limited research into K-12 online learning in an effort to better understand what is known about the effectiveness of K-12 online learning and how it can be utilized effectively.</p>

<br />
           	  
   <p> In this paper, we would like to reflect on the contentious debate about the role religious truth claims are envisioned to play in the political public sphere. In outlining the more recent reflections of J?rgen Habermas on the need for "translation" (of religious into secular language) in the public sphere, we aim first to shed light on the challenges a secular modernity faces in trying to strike a balance between individual and collective interests, especially regarding the friction religious citizens have come to encounter and/or bring about in public deliberation. While Habermas still adheres to his postmetaphysical epistemological framework, he has come to significantly reevaluate his understanding of secularization theory and sees in religion an untapped resource that can yet imbue upon modernity a greater sense of solidarity that liberal democratic states cannot by themselves generate. In our second section, we shift to the question to critiques of (post)modern epistemology raised by Charles Taylor, Hilary Putnam and Benedict XVI. Habermas' recent reflections indicate that a grounding of intersubjective morality in a thin universalism inherent in speech act theory may be insufficient in addressing the so-called B?ckenf?rde-problem (i.e. above-mentioned challenge for modern liberal democracies to account for solidarity by themselves). While fallible truths are seen to be negotiable in the public sphere, thick notions of the good, as well as claims of universality are frowned upon as though they necessitate an element of exclusion. While Habermas goes so far as to acknowledge religion as a potential resource of "binding forces" that could bring about greater solidarity, the latter thinkers insist on the degree to which thicker notions of the good (Taylor, Putnam), as well as universal truth claims (Benedict) can and should be granted a greater role in public deliberation in order to tap into unleash such binding forces. In our paper, we will reflect on the ways in which differing notions of truths/Truth relate to ideas about the necessary binding forces Habermas so vehemently seeks through procedural means.</p>

    <strong><em>"The Truth Revolution"</em></strong><br />

<br />
           	  
   <p> Truth plays ambiguous and ironic roles in American criminal law. The advent of DNA profiling has shaken the complacent world of police, prosecutors and courts to its core, stimulating a series of reforms that were impossible just a decade or two before.
Ambiguity. Layer 1. Truth as unassailable factual reconstruction of past events has been an unattainable goal of western courts for millennia. Judicial torture used in ancient Greece and Rome, and medieval and early modern Europe, sought to produce accurate confessions ("the Queen of Proof") where perfect proof was otherwise lacking. Modern American law evades truth by presumptions, general [i.e., unexplained] jury verdicts, and rules of finality. Professors of evidence law argue the philosophy of truth.
Layer 2. The general public assumes that truth is the goal of courts and the justice apparatus. Young lawyers soon learn that dispute resolution is the prime goal, and that truth is a device employed in the service of parties to satisfactorily resolve conflicts. In criminal law, plea bargains may be based on legal impossibilities (e.g., pleading to "attempted manslaughter). Alford pleas [defendant allowed to plead guilty while maintaining innocence] are inherently ambiguous abut truth. Police are under no legal obligation to gather exculpatory evidence. Prosecutors have no legal authority to order police to seek truth and have a limited obligation to divulge facts to defendants.
Layer 3. DNA profiling helped spark an innocence movement that had identified more than 1000 documented exonerations and reasonably asserts that perhaps ten thousand untrue felony convictions or more occur every year in American courts.
Irony. Layer 1. Two generations ago, in response to the rights-expanding agenda of the "liberal" Warren Court, a more "conservative" Supreme Court trimmed constitutionally-based procedural rights on the ground that they often trumped truth. A strong body of federal statutory law and court doctrines severely curtailed the ability of prisoners, and especially those on death row, to challenge the truth of their convictions.
Layer 2. As the ink was drying on the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, designed to curtail federal habeas corpus petitions, the number of DNA exonerations was rising, the Innocence Project had been formed, and Attorney General Janet Reno was placing actual innocence on the federal policy agenda, giving the lie to the truth assumptions that bolstered the conservative counterattack on suspects' and defendants' procedural rights.
My paper will briefly outline the development of the innocence movement and list its reforms and the accelerating pace of reform. It will explore the innocence movement's "truth revolution" through the ambiguous and ironic meaning and uses of truth in criminal law. An ambiguous theme is the law's posture regarding truth in non-DNA cases. Irony is pursued by considering the tension between privacy rights and the racial discrimination-reducing effect of widespread DNA profiling and the way in which the Supreme Court has been walking back its harsh habeas doctrines.

   <p> This paper looks at press interpretations of the role of images ? specifically, images of national enemies in death ? in constructing various duties of media truth-telling. Discourse about the need, or duty, to publish photos of the Nazi leaders hanged at Nuremberg in 1946 provides a context for examining discourse surrounding a similar decision that the White House faced after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. What was seen largely as a third-person effect seven decades ago is more often seen now as a first-person effect: We no longer need to persuade or daunt the slain enemy's die-hard followers, but we have created a set of obligations to persuade ? or please ? ourselves.</p>

    <strong><em>"The Genealogy of Parresia: Foucault on Democratic Politics and Truth-Telling"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  David Kim<br />
Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p> In June 1981, at the inaugural meeting of the International Committee Against Piracy, Foucault appealed to "an international citizenship" on behalf of the Vietnamese people. Since the Fall of Saigon hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese had fled their country by sea, but no government was willing to intervene in the horrifying pirate attacks in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea. So Foucault reminded his listeners of "an international citizenship" that obligated everyone "to speak out against every abuse of power, whoever its perpetrator, whoever its victims." He went on to say: "It is a duty of this international citizenship to bring always to the eyes and ears of governments the testimony of people's misfortunes for which it is not true that they are not responsible."* 
In this paper, I wish to use Foucault's hardly known speech on human rights as a springboard for working through a genealogy of parresia, or truth-telling, vis-?-vis democratic politics. As I illustrate, it not only resorts to ancient Greece for inspiration, but also responds to the unresolved Kantian question of modernity: what is Enlightenment? The aim of this paper, then, is to focus on the last four years of Foucault's scholarship and map out an adversarial, truth-telling model of democratic politics. I also shed light on Foucault's persistent trust in philosophy as a non-utopian, cautiously subversive site for criticizing governments, upholding human rights, and being world citizens. In this sense, I consider my essay to be a vital contribution to the latest Foucault scholarship.

    <strong><em>"Publically-engaged Humanities: a Practice of Truth? 
"</em></strong><br />

Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p> The predominance of postmodern theory in Cultural Studies in recent decades has stalled our capacity to imagine genuine possibilities for social change. Emphasizing notions of indeterminacy, performance, and dislocation, cultural theorists and political philosophers have challenged the viability of individual agency and universal truths. While this approach has strengthened the important role of critical analysis as pedagogical rationale and mode of inquiry, it has paradoxically risked turning the Humanities, or more specifically Literary and Cultural Studies, into a solipsistic, if not self-serving preoccupation with symptomatic or paranoid readings (Sedgwick). In this context, we often overlook the need and potential for exploring reparative, affirmative, and socially impactful modes of growth and renewal in our classrooms, research, and society as a whole.
In this paper, I argue that the current crisis of the Humanities is an important opportunity to reimagine the guiding principles of research and teaching conducted in a field concerned with the human condition. Rather than responding to dwindling resources with strategic pragmatism, I examine new integrative ways in which the Humanities - as field, theory, pedagogy, and ethical practice - can cultivate social change through public engagement and community-oriented teaching and research. Based on my teaching of a course on the Holocaust in the Education Justice Project at the University of Illinois, I argue that a deeply grounded personal and institutional engagement with those traditionally excluded from higher education (here incarcerated men at Danville Correctional Center) can strengthen the public role and democratic purpose of the Humanities within the university and beyond. This personal, reflective, and socially relevant approach aims to overcome the perpetual investment of academic debates in structurally determined impasses of agency. At the same time I ask, however, how a turn toward a more holistic orientation, involving universal truths and pedagogies of mutual respect, interconnection, reciprocal learning, grace and forgiveness across boundaries and difference can respond to the critique of such efforts as new "truth-regimes" (meaning, false, misguided ways that, according to Zizek, embody "the authoritarian spirit of community").

Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p> The purpose of my paper is to analyze the complex relationship between the French writer and theorist Serge Doubrovsky (who invented the category of auto-fiction and used it in his novel Fils), and his American analyst Doctor Robert Ackeret. I will focus on the different values of truth presented either in the analytic situation, or in the fictional one. In order to do that, I will compare/contrast Doubrovsky's novel Fils (l977) in which Ackeret is the protagonist of the chapter name "Reves", and Ackeret's Tales from a Traveling Couch. A Psychotherapist Revisits His Most Memorable Patients in which he dedicates one chapter to describe Doubrovsky (under the name of Sacha the Beast), and narrate his analysis. This distinction will be drawn from the relationship between the fictionist/patient and the analyst/writer in order to understand the different categories of truth used by each of them. In summary: my main interest resides in studying the confrontation, competition and mutual cannibalism between a writer who incorporated so much of the psychoanalytic theory (and the psychoanalytic situation) in his auto-fiction, and the analyst who pretended to become a writer by fictionalizing his most prominent patients.</p>

<br />
           	  
   <p> As the "counterpart" or "offshoot" of philosophy, as Aristotle described it, the art of rhetoric has historically had an uncomfortable relationship with the concept of truth. Though his contemporaries, the sophists, questioned the reality of "truth," Aristotle believed that truth and justice would prevail when sound arguments were presented by ethical speakers, even if the discovery of truth itself were outside the scope of rhetorical method. Most of today's rhetorical scholars, if pressed, would side with the sophists on this question. This talk will acknowledge the usefulness of rhetorical method in the investigation of the world of variable phenomena without questioning the reality of truth itself. Instead, it will draw on a set of spiritual practices based in Judeo-Christian-Buddhist traditions to reconcile the author's spiritual and academic lives. Within this practice rhetoric may be seen as an accurate description of the human condition without supplanting or questioning the truth and reality of the spiritual. The author will draw on theory in materialist and embodied rhetorics to illustrate this spiritual tradition's disregard of the material in favor of the reality of the abstract.

   <p>Since the Post-9/11 GI Bill  passed in 2009, universities and colleges, many designated as &ldquo;military  friendly,&rdquo; have experienced a dramatic change in their student demographic. A  &ldquo;first wave&rdquo; of research about student-veterans has emerged; that research  focuses primarily on veterans&rsquo; transition to civilian life, the impact of  signature wounds (TBI and PTS) on learning, and the need for universities to  implement support services, such as GI Bill benefits coordinators. Understated  in the majority of this initial research are discussions of the moral  imperatives and ideological conflicts that veterans&rsquo; presence in our classrooms  and communities makes poignant and pressing.

   <p> When debating controversial subjects, one often hears the claim, "That's just your opinion!" The trouble with this claim is that its meaning is often unclear. Presumably, the speaker wishes to contrast opinion with something else?perhaps truth or fact. But standard renditions of the fact/opinion distinction are hopelessly muddy. In this paper I explore the nature of opinion, mainly by contrasting the fact/opinion distinction with other distinctions in the vicinity, including the belief/reality distinction, the subjective/objective distinction, and the descriptive/normative distinction. Attention to these reveals that the claim "That's just your opinion" is typically either confused, unhelpful, or both.

                <p> The main aim of this paper is to propose and defend a slightly speculative explanation for the moderately high frequency of "relativism" about truth among college freshmen (and presumably also some larger segment of the population).  My suggested explanation is that college freshmen (and people at large) do not appreciate the referential functions of language; this leads them into confusion about what may and what may not be settled by stipulatation or convention; this in turn leads to a confusion between what sentences are true, and what ones satisfy prevailing norms of acceptable belief, assertibility, and the like.  The upshot is that truth is conflated with belief (of a subject, a community, an ingroup or something of the sort). <br/>
                  To begin to explain and motivate this suggestion.  I will offer two cases and suggest a general moral.  
                  For the first case, I would like to solve one of the great philosophical problems. <br/>

By a strange coincidence, the humans on this planet speak a language that is almost indistinguishable from English.  The only difference is that what we call a "leg" they call a "tail", and what we call a "tail" they call a "leg".

              <p>How do languages talk about truth and untruth and  about things that didn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t happen? In this research, I compare how  English and Chinese express contrary-to-fact statements, i.e. counterfactuals, and conclude that in addition to lexicon and context,  syntax matters in Chinese untruth-telling as well. Unlike English, which  resorts to <strong><u>past tense</u></strong> and  sometimes <strong><u>structural inversion</u></strong> to mark counterfactual truth conditions (e.g. <em>I wish I were you</em>, or <em>If I  had gone?</em>,or <em>Should he arrive tomorrow</em>?), Chinese, lacking  verbal morphology, is argued to employ a handful of <strong><u>lexical items</u></strong> (e.g. wo <strong><u>yiwei</u></strong> ni qu (I-had.thought-you-go: &lsquo;I had thought you would go.&rsquo;)) or <strong><u>context</u></strong> to disambiguate factuals  vs. counterfactuals on a truth functional account (Wu 1989). Bloom (1981)  suggests that, not equipped with syntactic devices to distinguish  counterfactuals from factuals, Chinese speakers cannot reason counterfactually cognitively.  Au (1984) challenges Bloom&rsquo;s linguistic determinism, i.e. language conditions  cognitive ability. Furthermore, I propose that <strong><u>syntax</u></strong> in fact serves as a third factor that contributes to  the construction and interpretation of counterfactuality in Chinese: <strong><u>past reference in hypothetical <em>if</em>-clause can only have past counterfactual  interpretation</u></strong>. First, without tense inflection on the verb, past time  adverbials (e.g. <em>yesterday</em>, <em>last year</em>) and context are responsible  for past reference in Chinese; second, hypothetical <em>if</em>-clauses are conditionals or protases that allow &lsquo;then&rsquo; in the matrix  clause or apodoses in English (e.g. <em>If  you are late, <strong><u>then</u></strong>I will get  upset</em>) or <em>jiu </em>in Chinese (Bhatt  &amp; Pancheva 2006); relevance counterfactuals, on the other hand, do not allow  &lsquo;then&rsquo; or<em> jiu</em> in the protasis (e.g. <em>If you need a contractor, call me</em>). This  syntactic mechanism in Chinese, however, can only express past counterfactuals,  which makes it reasonable to hypothesize that, typologically, if a language can  only mark one kind of temporal counterfactuals structurally, it must be the  past-reference counterfactual, not the present or future.</p>

    <strong><em>&quot;Reconstructing the truth of German past: the  Objective Pursuit of Historical Truth of Leopold von Ranke"</em></strong>
      <p><strong>Shih-chieh Su<br />
                Delaware Valley College </strong></p>
              <p>The conception of historical scholarship, as Leopold von Ranke advocated, was embedded in the<br />
                nascent development of the historical discipline, which sought to empower professional historians<br />
                to restore the &quot;objective reality&quot; within the parameters of a nationalist historiography. In his<br />
                &quot;unstable narrative&quot; of the German past, the tension was apparent: while Ranke, as a professional<br />
                historian, employed a rigorous scientific method to pursue historical objectivity, as a public<br />
                intellectual he acknowledged his inability to conceal subjective sympathy toward the monarchy and<br />
                his abiding support of the Prussia-led German unification.<br />
                <br />
                To mitigate this probable conflict, Ranke practically proposed a normative procedure of<br />
                historiographical forgetting that entailed deliberately selecting and arranging historical materials<br />
                while conducting objective inquiries. He professionally believed that the universal truth would<br />
                promptly reveal itself, if he were able to retrieve, restore and represent the past in its authenticity.<br />
                In this formulation, the truth essentially transcends the distinctive boundaries of time and space. To<br />
                extract the pure facts and to restore the studied past with authenticity, he needed to discard<br />
                (forget) all the possible subjective elements of imagination from the documented and archival<br />
                artifacts, and to subordinate the remaining actual facts to the discursive elements, which aimed to<br />
                support his objective reconstruction of the national past within the context of universal history.<br />
                <br />
                Yet, Ranke's reconstruction of an objective version of the German past unavoidably intersected<br />
                with subjective political preferences, selective remembering and forgetting and an imagined<br />
                continuity of historical time. Therefore, the scope of historical objectivity was limited to the<br />
                significant events that could be historically correlated with his subject matter and validated by the<br />
                perspective of &quot;future past.&quot; This notion of temporal continuity enabled him to disclose elements of<br />
                universal significance and future-looking benefits, and to stabilize the changing perceptions of<br />
                historical actors in time. His pursuit of an authentic past did not seek to restore the past with<br />
                complete authenticity, but rather to imbue the past with meaning, whose transcendence was<br />
                defined by current perceptions of historical time. Namely, Ranke imagined a harmonious synthesis<br />
                of the historian's subjectivity with an ideal of objectivity &quot;out there&quot; as the truth to be discovered in<br />
                reality. As a result, his creation of a realistic picture of a selected past and his rationalization of a<br />
                fantasized reality essentially empowered his choice of model or moral act regarding how humans<br />
                ought to live, which served conclusively as the founding principle of the modern historical discipline.</p>

              <p>Like other crimes against humanity perpetrated during the 20th century, the mass murders<br />
                committed in the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin were hidden under the cloak of secrecy. After<br />
                Stalin's death, the absence of reliable documents or witnesses made it difficult to reconstruct what<br />
                happened. The burden thus fell to the survivors themselves to tell the truth of the Stalinist Gulag.<br />
                Varlam Shalamov, a Russian writer who miraculously survived 14 years in the notorious prison<br />
                camps of the Far East, wrote six cycles of short stories called Kolyma Tales about his experience.<br />
                Initially understood as memoirs, there is now sufficient evidence that they straddle the line between<br />
                fact and fiction. Nonetheless, Shalamov repeatedly insisted upon the truth of his works. Some<br />
                scholars dismiss the factual discrepancies and instances of artistic license in his stories as<br />
                insignificant and focus on their literary and philosophical truth, rather than their historical<br />
                accuracy. This paper will argue that guiding principle of the Kolyma Tales is the representation of<br />
                the psychological experiences of both the victim and the survivor. An examination of these stories in<br />
                light of contemporary clinical psychology reveals the astounding degree to which Shalamov<br />

    <strong><em>"The end of truth in planning in the coming era of the libertarian paternalistic planner"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b> Rayman Mohamed<br />

   <p> For a number of decades, planning theory has revolved around communicative rationality: truthful communication that leads to rational action. Although sometimes downplayed by planning academics, the resulting rational action implicitly assumes perfect rationality and planning practice and scholarship are still stepped in this rationality (see, e.g, Verma 1996 for a discussion). Indeed, leading planning texts, for example, on land use (Berke, Godschalk et al. 2006) and environmental planning (Randolph 2012) still employ the rational adaptive model.

In this paper, I argue that wider developments across the social sciences are about to consume planners' obsession with the truth-telling embedded in communicative rationality. Spurred by the work of psychologists David Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1974, 1984), sociologists, political scientists, and economists are using "behavioral psychology" to find new and novel ways to answer important policy questions. 

An important consideration in this behavioral approach is the "nudge" (see Thaler and Sunstein 2009 for origins of the term), which is government action designed to guide individuals to make better decisions. One example of nudging is the "framing" of policy discussions to emphasize a direction preferred by policy makers, such as emphasizing harms from global warming to encourage less fossil fuel consumption.

Nudging, however, requires planners to be less than perfectly truthful. As the wider social sciences influence the practice of planning, these "libertarian paternalistic" planners will provide choice but?driven by public policy concerns?will nudge people to make choices that are better for cities. Such a planner might, for instance, set "default" zoning and subdivision ordinances to encourage denser development, frame questions about global warming in terms of the loss of local lives and local amenities, and frame public transit?as opposed to cars?as the default mode of transportation. This approach to planning will upend the current "communicative" framework in which planners operate. The emergence of the libertarian paternalistic planner signals the end of the era of truth in planning and provides a new positivist theory on how planners plan.

    <strong><em>"Truth and the First Amendment: The People Must Decide"</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b> Robert Sedler<br />
Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p>It is an essential postulate of the First Amendment that only the people can decide what is "true." This postulate manifests itself in a number of ways. First and most importantly, under the First Amendment, the government cannot declare that there are "false" ideas. The underlying theory of the First Amendment is that there is a marketplace of ideas, in which all ideas are entitled to enter and to compete for public approval. Since the government cannot declare an idea to be false, this means that what most of us -and the rest of the world - would consider to be a "false idea, such as genocide or racism is protected by the First Amendment. It is said that under the First Amendment, the remedy for "bad speech" is "more speech, not enforced silence. It is for this reason that in the United States we give more constitutional protection to freedom of speech than is provided under the constitutions of other democratic nations and under international human rights norms.

Second, under the First Amendment, we must tolerate a good deal of "falsity" in order to prevent a chilling effect on the discussion of public issues. This has led to what is called The New York Times rule, which means that the media cannot be held liable disseminating false information about a public official or public figure unless the information is knowingly false or rendered with reckless disregard for truth of falsity. Since all media organizations have adopted internal procedures to ensure compliance with the New York Times rule, a public official or public figure cannot maintain a successful defamation action against the media.

Third, the government generally cannot make it a crime to deliberately lie. The Supreme Court recently held unconstitutional a law making it a crime to lie about receiving a military medal or decoration. The Court held that it is up to the public to decide whether or not the statement - here a false statement by a public official that he had received the Congressional Medal of Honor - was true or false.
