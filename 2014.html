<h3>Explication</h3>
<div id="text">
  <p>In 2010, veteran Detroit journalist John Gallagher published Reimagining Detroit: Opportunities for<br />
      Redefining an American City. The title of this book, one of a series of postmortems published about Detroit in the past five years, takes a familiar form. By affixing the prefix &quot;re,&quot; Gallagher sparks our imaginations and invites us to reimagine and redefine a city in decline. Such discussions often imply that the archetypical modern industrial city, epitomized by rustbelt metropolises like Detroit and Cleveland, is an anachronism, destined to fade into obsolescence as new forms of social organization take its place. The city thus needs to be rebuilt, rethought, repopulated, redeveloped, recreated, redefined. In other words, we need to re: the city.<br />
      <br />
      The prefix &quot;re&quot; can also carry a negative connotation. If we re: the city, might this mean a regression to an undesirable past state? After years of living in recession, are urban residents in need of another reiteration of economic renewal? Is there really the possibility of positive social change or are contemporary urban areas simply unable to overcome the recriminations of past racial, political and economic conflicts?<br />
      <br />
      The use of the prefix &quot;re&quot; implies a specific relationship between future and past actions. When we discuss re: the city, do these discussions unavoidably imply that the original form was somehow<br />
      impermanent, inadequate and needs to be redone; if so, is this a problem? Is a city reborn or recreated really the same space or is this new entity distinct in important ways; if not, do we care? If we re: the city, how do we do it? What are the implications of re: the city for social, economic, or political life. What are the implications of such changes for artistic renderings of the urban and urbanity?</p>

  <div id="text">
  <strong>Julius Wilson<br />
    Harvard University</strong>
  <p><em><strong>The Truly Disadvantaged Revisited: Critical Reflections on the Recent Research on Concentrated Urban Poverty</strong></em></p>
  <p>William Julius Wilson's keynote address comes a year and several months after the 25th anniversary publication of his landmark book The Truly Disadvantaged.  He will briefly reflect on the major issues raised in the book, and then critically discuss some of the important research on neighborhood effects, a topic that has received a good deal of attention from scholars across social science disciplines since the book's publication.  The question of why this research has generated conflicting conclusions on the importance of urban neighborhoods for social outcomes will be addressed.  His presentation concludes with a discussion of thoughtful holistic policy interventions based on studies that carefully integrate empirical and theoretical arguments.</p><p>Video :

  <p>?As a 20 year professor at WSU, the Artistic-Director of the Detroit Jazz Festival (now the largest free Jazz Festival in the world), and an active international jazz artist, I am in the unique position to create new initiatives designed to unite cultural, educational, and artistic communities/institutions. Goals include: creating meaningful long-term jazz educational collaborations, providing new venues for artistic excellence, celebrating and promoting the unique history and current creative spirit in Detroit music, documenting traditions and solidifying resources for future generations, strengthening Detroit as a global center for jazz, enhancing the city's overall global reputation by fostering positive initiatives for youth, university, and professional artists that demonstrate successes in Detroit.</p>

    <strong><em>Detroit Future City: The Ultimate Victory of Capitalism over Community Government</em></strong><br />
           	  <br />
           	  <b> Jose Cuello<br />
Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p>?Businessmen have  long attempted to influence and control government from the city to the  national levels to maximize profits by obtaining favorable legislation,  lowering taxes and weakening regulations.?  Within Western Civilization, we can trace this pattern back to the  Ancient Greece and the Renaissance.? The  English, American and French Revolutions were victories of the commercial  classes over the Old Order of kings, nobles, and clergy. The United States War  for Independence was led by the profit-making colonial elites, merchants and  planter philosophers and politicians who create a nation built on commerce.  Since then our important urban centers have been governed by our economic  elites. Until now, they have been largely content to work with the cumbersome  mechanisms of democratic government in which the citizen voters are courted to  participate in the election of their public officials.? </p>
   <p>??????????? While following the principle that  what is good for business is good for the community, public officials have  generally taken seriously their obligations to secure the public good in  economics, politics and culture.? However  imperfectly, the public's voice has been heard through the electoral process  and through public protests when necessary. The crash of Capitalism in the  Great Depression even led to the New Deal creation of the Welfare State in  which an economic safety net was created for the working poor and families in  need.? The economic prosperity of the  Post-WWII era until the 1970s allowed for the expansion of a national public  policy that favored investment in economic and physical health of the citizenry  and led to the growth of the middle class.? <br />
     Since the 1970s, especially since  the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, the business community has attacked government  social services programs as undeserved, costly projects that need to be terminated.? In a return to a 19th century survival-of-the  fittest strategy, the major corporate interests have decided that city  governments that attempt to serve the needs of the people must be taken over  completely, without the cumbersome democratic process, in order to make the  governments live within severely reduced budgets.? In fact, government services are now being  turned into sources of profit through privatization in the name of economic  efficiency.? </p>
??????????? Detroit has become a  proto-type for the business model solution to the crisis of democratic public  government.? The strategic plan entitled  Detroit Future City developed by the Bing Administration, adopted by the  Emergency Manager and new mayor as the road map for the next fifty years, will re-invent  Detroit as a city of corporate buildings, landscaped greens and lakes, and  housing for the high income individuals who can afford to pay for their own  city services, as if the city were a giant condominium.? Corporation and foundations will make the  decisions in the Future City of Detroit in the ultimate victory of Capitalism  over community and the ideal of democratic self-government. <p>

    <strong><em>Picturing Progress And Decline: Photographic Depictions Of The Urban-Industrial Landscape In Two Eras Of Development</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  James Murgatroyd Dickinson<br />
Ryder University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p>Visual  depictions of the urban landscape may be thought of as existing at three  levels: as imagined, internal or subjective constructs of residents or  visitors; as formal designs, plans or maps devised by planners, engineers and  other municipal agents; and as the aesthetic constructions of artists and  photographers. If everyday vernacular representations of the city are highly  variable and unrealistic, and official versions over-determined and ideal, then  it is worth exploring the contributions of artists and photographers to the  interpretation of urban space. Indeed, in this regard I argue that photography,  especially landscape photography, has a special capacity to capture and track  the effects of human activity on the environment, thus distill in the  photographic image evidence of the abstract forces, values and cultural  precepts informing the <em>Weltanschauung</em> , or spirit? of  an age.?</p>
   <p>In this paper I explore contributions of landscape photography  to the depiction and cultural interpretation of the industrial/urban landscape  in two eras or stages of socio-economic development: an ascendant,  &quot;whirlpool&quot; capitalism (modernity), and a more recent, globalized and  decentralized &quot;late&quot; capitalism (postmodernity). I distinguish  between modernist interpretations which use techniques of formalism to depict  functioning industrial landscapes at the center of the development dynamic,  seeing them as positive expressions of national power, the dignity of labor, or  the virtues of technological progress; and postmodern interpretations in which photographers  treat the exhausted and ruined landscapes found at the center and periphery of  a now-globalized, decentralized economy as expressions of the failure of  technology, the limits of economic growth, and the destructive effects of human  activity on the environment. I argue that in this regard the history of  landscape photography tracks a shift from modernist perspectives which in one  way or another celebrate landscapes of production to a postmodern sensibility  which sees their transformation into the landscapes of post-industrial and  hyper-consumption.</p>
   <p> To  begin, I briefly distinguish between modernity and post-modernity as eras of  transformative social, economic and cultural change. I then discuss how artists  active in the European avant-garde during the early decades of the twentieth  century came to appreciate the emerging industrial landscape as providing the vocabulary  of pure forms necessary for development of a modern up-to-date aesthetic. Next  I look at three outstanding modernist photographers whose work established new  meaning and significance for emerging landscapes of industry: Albert  Renger-Patzsch who photographed the Ruhr valley in the late 1920s and early  1930s; Soviet pioneer, Aleksandr Rodchenko, who wanted to develop photography  as a proletarian art as it recorded the triumphs of Soviet industrialization;  and the American precisionist, Charles Sheeler, famous for his iconic  photographs of Henry Ford's gigantic River Rouge plant in Detroit. I compare  and contrast their work with respect to subject matter depicted, formal  techniques developed or employed to organize the image, noting how the order  and energy they perceived in the emerging man-made landscape helped advance a narrative  of inevitable industrialization, socialist utopia, or efficiency and progress. </p>
<p>In  the second part of the essay I explore how photographers respond to and  interpret post-modern landscapes which have emerged more recently both in the  older centers of modernity and at the newly developing periphery, noting how  they apply new photographic methods as well as extend traditional ones to the  study of the contemporary landscape. Here I consider Bernd and Hilla Becher&rsquo;s  taxonomic studies of the vast range of anonymous functional buildings and  structures found scattered across?  industrial landscapes; Robert Smithson&rsquo;s little known &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo;  photographs of slag heaps and industrial detritus, as well as his elaborate  experiments in inter-textuality designed to bring to consciousness the immanent  forces of transcendent entropy; photographers associated with the New  Topologies movement who take as their subject matter the newly-emerging  consumer landscapes of parking lots, suburban housing developments, office  parks, warehouses, airports, superhighways, power lines, and waste dumps;  photographers such as Camilo Vergara who specializes in serial documentation of  the ruined and abandoned landscapes of urban America; and contemporary  landscape photographers such as Edward Burtynsky and Sze Tsung Leong whose  massive, highly aestheticized portraits of mining and other ravaged landscapes,  cityscapes, and mega-projects record the environmental costs of rampant industrialization  in both old and new centers of development. </p>
   <p>?My conclusion is that photography provides  varied and interesting commentaries (a discourse, if you will) on those  powerful forces transforming the urban industrial environment in both modernism  and postmodernism, establishing meaning and significance for the distinctive  landscapes called into being in the course of these two phases of development.</p>

    <strong><em>The Cooperative City</em></strong><br />

   <p>This article would lay out what it would mean if we took the decay and  despair of the city, utilize the remaining resources and public support, and  fashion a city based on the coop model--certainly at a scale offered by  Mondragon, an international cooperative in Spain that employs over 200,000  people active in many coordinated cooperative enterprises. A city based on this  model would eventually sustain 300,000 workers, most of whom can't get work  under current conditions in Detroit; without mass transit in a region where  almost 80% of jobs are more than 10 miles from the downtown, work of any kind  is hard to find.&nbsp; Recent research on worker cooperatives demonstrates that  they fail at rates that are lower than conventionally owned and financed  firms.&nbsp; For example, had Detroit taken over the abandoned Poletown plant  Chrysler sold to the city for $1, and invested the $200+ million to update the  plant organized as a worker cooperative, jobs would have been saved (directly  and among those in the surrounding community that was demolished to prepare the  site).? Consumers would have bought a  very durable car delivered at the factory gate at a very low price, sustaining  the workers' cooperative. Enterprise level labor democracy can anticipate an  urban policy agenda for failing cities abandoned by capital, heralding a  proactive program to reconfigure urban production to avoid the demise due to  capital flight.&nbsp; With about 75% of all African Americans in Michigan  living under executive dictatorships (i.e. emergency managers sweeping aside  elected governments), this project breaks the link between electoral democracy  (which gets you nothing if the apparatus is forced to respond to the needs of  capital) and workplace democracy; workers end up having control in the one  arena that matters most and the city is no longer subject to the whims of the  market and the vagaries of the global economy.</p>

This presentation focuses on the  service-learning and volunteer strategies of ArtsCorpsDetroit, and ways in which Wayne State students and alumni  are contributing to reshaping the city. Emerging data indicate that  service-learning fosters civic responsibility in students and motivation to  continue their community service after completion of? their service-learning  assignments. Data show that art empowers citizens by mobilizing  solutions and creativity developed through relationships between individuals  and collaborations between university and community groups.

   <p> The relationship between art, capitalism and urban space is a long and complex one. The development of an artistic field in certain cities and times ?Paris in the XIX Century, New York after 1950? speaks of the connections between capital's concentration and the emergence of an art sphere in which, art's autonomy and its value as a commodity are interrelated. The prolonged decline of the City Detroit, which testifies the fall of the capitalist myth of local endless growth, opens up a door to imagine art emerging at capital's withdrawal. </p>
   <p>This yearlong performative and cartographic project explores the city of Detroit as a fecund ground for art as praxis, i.e. as something we do as part of life, or while living. Re-thinking the Fence works as a series of urban interventions performed using orange security fence as a material index of the modification of the city's infrastructure: every time a building is demolished or built the fence appears as a territorial mark. The fence speaks of the way in which the city's space is being reconfigured. It is a sign of the sites where capital is operating, such as Central Depot: our most cherished ruin. </p>
   <p>Found as construction remain at the Michigan Central Station, the security fence has been transformed: it has been bended, tied up, cut and re-organized within its material limits; its industrial origin has been re-valuated by the hand: manu-factured. Later on following a tracing system of walking urban derives (d?rive), the remade fence has been installed throughout Detroit, connecting isolated areas of the city and revisiting sites of historical importance such as the epicenter of the 1967 uprisings. In this sense the remade fence works as a thread weaving among algid points of the city's memory creating a subsumed cartography of Detroit's historical spatialization of capital.</p>

   <p>In the shift from manufacturing industry to information economy, the winners and saviors in select<br />
     neighborhoods are the largely affluent, educated creative classes while the gaps largely leave behind<br />
     most others. The two narratives, one of decline by brain drain and another of growth by opportunity<br />
     run parallel. In describing and heralding a new creative economy, the impacts of what is properly<br />
     unequal gentrification with the accompanying affects on age, race and class divides leaves these<br />
     disruptive impacts unchecked and unexamined.</p>
   <p> The flea market just past the Vernor/Dix split in southwest Detroit, represents a unique space where<br />
     the uneven dynamics of urban gentrification are in transformation. There, in a space formerly used<br />
     for industry to park cars, now a transient space for informal commerce emerges: wood stands selling<br />
     used car parts, cell phone chargers, figures of the Guadalupe Virgin and athletic socks re-inhabit the<br />
     once abandoned parking lot. Moreover, the Vernor Flea Market operates as a space where the racial<br />
     and cultural gaps present in the diverse populations of Southwest Detroit are, momentarily and<br />
     strategically, sutured. In this sense the flea market works as what the French philosopher Michel<br />
     Foucault identified as &quot;heterotopias&quot;: enacted utopias or counter-sites that simultaneously represent<br />
     and contest hegemonic configurations of power within society.</p>
   <p> A Stand for Creative Action is a cultural and political dispositive that fosters the heterotopic powers<br />
     of the flea market. This stand offers pi?ata making workshops, the production of a locally designed<br />
     newspaper, exhibitions of the handiwork of local bakers, and dialogue on the role of creativity in our<br />
     city. Articulating a third narrative of community based creative work, A Stand for Creative Action<br />
     asks artists, designers and locals to actively interrogate questions of race and gentrification through<br />
     the collective construction and use of a physical structure.</p>
   <p> The Stand for Creative Action:<br />
     ? Creates social and political consciousness through creative projects<br />
     ? Conducts community-based research through active productions in art, design, cultural<br />
     theory<br />

   <strong><em>Re(Visualizing) Voice in Composition: Toward a Responsive Approach to Honoring, Preserving, and Protecting Urban African American Youth Voices</em></strong><br />

   <p>Voice became a  pivotal point of discussion in composition studies around 1960 (see Randall Freisinger-1974;  Deborah Brandt-1990; Suresh A. Canagarajah-2004). However, lately, discussions about voice have been MIA  (missing in action), although, as composition scholar Peter Elbow indicates,  &ldquo;The concept of voice? is alive in our [composition] classrooms.&rdquo; In this  paper, I explore the written presence of voice by examining the ways in which three urban African  American youth from inner-city Detroit, MI, engage with the written concept of  voice across home, community, and school settings?and in specific, in postsecondary  first-year composition settings. ?</p>
   <p>Through  discourse analysis and a range of written and recorded interactions, it will be  shown that most urban African American youth use syntactical and lexical  features of African American Language in order to orient themselves to the  concept of &ldquo;voice in writing&rdquo;. This leads to a construction of what it means to  be an urban African American writer engaging with voice?a construction that  places an understanding of the cultural and social workings of urbanism and  language at the forefront. </p>
   <p>This research aligns  with recent scholarship on culturally and linguistically responsive pedagogy  (see Geneva Gay 2002; Sharroky Hollie-2011). Using this pedagogy as a  heuristic, I will show how &ldquo;voice in writing&rdquo; can be categorized into a  holistic responsive approach that honors, preserves, and protects urban African  American youth cultural and social conceptions of &ldquo;voice in writing&rdquo;. It is within  this particular approach that urban African American youth conceptions of  &ldquo;voice in writing&rdquo; is reworked into a construction of humanization.</p>

   <p>The paper addresses the impact of neighborhood  characteristics on residents' health by describing how assets and deficits of  place are related to individual health status. The study was conducted as part  of the Sociology of Urban Health course, SOC 6750/8710 in Winter 2014.? Research was conducted in eight neighborhoods  in Southeastern Michigan (Ypsilanti, Indian Village, Poletown, Corktown,  Southwest Detroit, Downtown Southwest Detroit, New Center, and Midtown/Cass  Corridor).? Data were obtained from a  variety of sources, including systematic social observations, the 2010 Census,  health department data, and various secondary data sources.? Measures of health included rates of  morbidity, mortality, chronic conditions, and health behaviors. Neighborhood  assets included: churches, urban gardens, health centers, day care centers,  neighborhood watch groups, collective efficacy, parks, playgrounds,  walkability, voluntary organizations, health care facilities, and social  service agencies.? Neighborhood deficits  were liquor stores, physical barriers, abandoned and decayed houses and  buildings, fast food restaurants, graffiti, vacant lots, poverty, public intoxication, garbage,  abandoned cars, broken windows, trash, broken bottles, drug paraphernalia in  gutters, and loitering. The paper discusses four  mechanisms identified by Galster, 2012 (social interactive, environmental,  geographical, and institutional) that link neighborhood characteristics to  health and concludes with recommendations for programs that could improve the  health of residents in a recreated city.</p>

    <strong><em>The City as Virtuality: Postindustrial Configurations of Urban Intensity</em></strong><br />

   <p>Taking up the challenge of the theme &quot;re: the city,&quot; I distance myself from the interpretation of<br />
     the first part of this phrase as somehow doing something again or anew, or, alternatively,<br />
     indulging in a nostalgic regression to what may once have been?but in most cases never was.<br />
     Instead, I wish to focus on &quot;the city,&quot; not so much in the future or the past, but rather as a<br />
     generative spatial configuration in and of the present. Cities, in their individuality and<br />
     idiosyncrasy, are and always have been both distinct spatial formations and imaginaries.<br />
     However, the contemporary postindustrial city is fundamentally different from &quot;the city&quot; before<br />
     urban sprawl, global mobility, and an increasingly diffuse exchange and distribution of<br />
     information effectively succeeded in eroding the traditional distinction between the city and<br />
     the countryside. The &quot;urban&quot; as it is unfolding today is inevitably the irreducible product of<br />
     mixture; a mixture of different kinds of mobilities, including flows or people, of information and<br />
     commodities, as much as a mixture of dreams (or nightmares), fantasies, and affects. !<br />
     </p>
   <p>In this paper, I will assume a position of hope and explore the postindustrial city as a virtuality,<br />
     as a set of potentials that contain unpredictable elements, which are generated by the coevolution?<br />
     the intensity of various flows, of things, of people, of institutions, of architectural<br />
     forms, of networks of communications, of interaction?that simultaneously co-constitute<br />
     problems and solutions. <br />
     </p>
   <p>I will focus my inquiry on the city of Detroit?the city in which I live and work, and about which I<br />
     have thought and written in various forms and for different venues?but my overall purpose will<br />
     be to reflect upon the 21st-century postindustrial city as a material as well as a theoretical<br />
     configuration that can perhaps best be understood as a virtual site of intensity.</p>

At its core, the attraction  of contemporary Detroit lies in its representation as simultaneously location  of &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and &ldquo;survival&rdquo; framed in the twinned tropes of 20th  century greatness and decline.?

   <p>In  early 2014 the Motor City Mapping Project performed a city-wide survey of the  380,000 parcels making up Detroit, MI. The recently commissioned Detroit Blight  Task Force launched the mapping initiative in order to document property  conditions and identify those derelict and dangerous properties requiring  demolition or remediation. Mobilizing public and private resources, LOVELAND  Technologies and Data Driven Detroit, two Detroit-based civic innovation and  data analysis groups, coordinated and supervised the project. The survey was  administered over several months and recruited dozens of teams of temporary  workers and volunteers. Survey teams were provided mobile devices installed  with a proprietary LOVELAND application called Blexting that enabled local,  non-expert surveyors to classify property details and attach a validating image  to each parcel's specific geolocation.  Property condition details and images were then automatically transmitted to  Motor City Mapping Project's headquarters where staff  reviewed and vetted parcel information. The Detroit Blight Task Force  anticipates releasing a plan and policy recommendations based on this  information by the end of April 2014.</p>
   <p>Though  the final results of the survey are not available, the Motor City Mapping  Project is ripe for investigating the practices and politics of studying and  improving a city. Taking urban planning's  local indicator literature and Science, Technology and Society as points of  reference and takeoff, this paper will examine how supervisory teams behind the  Motor City Mapping Project reconstruct and reassemble property details  collected by Blexting into credible knowledge that the Detroit Blight Task  Force will deploy to justify policy actions. The author will identify and  analyze those practices and decisions involved in transforming the City of  Detroit from a zone overcast with dereliction into an intelligible space for  intervention. A portion of this paper will also trace the emergence of the  Motor City Mapping Project's blight categorization  scheme. By ethnographically approaching the work of LOVELAND Technologies and  Data Driven Detroit the author will detail those techniques and devices that  were mixed together to execute the Motor City Mapping Project. </p>
This paper represents a novel synthesis of  social science literatures and scholarly perspectives. The fields of urban  planning and STS remain uneasy and infrequent collaborators. Integrating these  disciplinary sensibilities can in part enrich analysis of the production of  planning knowledge and expertise in cities after abandonment. By addressing the  knowledge-making practices invented and involved in quantifying and managing  blight in Detroit, this project can assist in understanding the efforts of  urban data scientists and civic technologists. Such scholarly work is  especially salient at a time when urban informatics is being cemented as a  foundational part of the planning profession. Distressed cities like Detroit  are being reconfigured as sites for the negotiation of an emergent datapolitics  and data-citizenship. Disclosing and unfolding the  properties of these practices may elaborate tensions found in institutional and  instrumental knowledge production.

    <strong><em>The Limits of Decline - A Paradigm Shift to Smart Urban Shrinkage or Pursuing the Path of Growth?</em></strong><br />
           	  <br /><b>  Rene Kreichauf<br />
Wayne State University</b>
<br />
           	  
   <p>At the beginning of the 21st century, the shrinking cities
phenomenon spread widely over western societies.It reflects the consequences of the shift from Fordism to post-Fordism and the
increasingly impact of globalisation on urban development.The causes are linked with both the urban development in the Fordist
and the post-Fordist era,and both modes and their features on the
patterns of cities do have impacts on today's urban development.
The Fordist era strongly changed the structure of Western cities
for a long term.Hence,today we have to deal with both, the impact
and the heritage of Fordism together with new challenges of post-Fordist trends on urban development.</p>
   <p> It is a fact though, that the new distribution of economic structures in the post-Fordist era has led to agglomerations of  activities in some regions, whereas others are experiencing decline. The multidimensional process is caused by different and complex trends that are strongly linked with each other. Also, the spatial impression and consequences for cities are different and influenced by the historial, economic, and political structures of the city or even country. Nevertheless, urban decline is a basic international trend in today's urban development. It has to be clear, that with the end of Fordism the end of comprehensive urban growth was initiated. </p>
   <p>In the European discourse on city shrinkage, scholars claim for a paradigm shift from traditional theories and approaches of urban growth to other ways of planning urban life that would focus on the quality of space and slower but smarter growth, as well as a sustainable and governed urban retreat. Therefore, the "acceptance of urban decline" as a path in urban development, and a refocusing on the way that planning instruments and mechanism are implied, are demanded (B?rkner 2005; H?u?ermann 2008). </p>
   <p>However, using theories on uneven urban development (Harvey 1989; Soja 1992; Castells 1991; Wissen and Neumann 2008; Brenner 2004; Sassen 2001) and the case studies of Bitterfeld (Germany) and Detroit (USA), this paper illustrates that within the context of capitalism and its logics, there is nothing such as an "acceptance of decline" or even a "departure of the growth path". On the long run, cities are forced to generate (economic) growth to further compete in the global economy. Thus, this contribution points out that strategies such as "regeneration", "re-imagining", "redevelopment", and "renewal" are in the end an alibi to justify a "re-growing" of declining cities ? not on population, but certainly on economic activity and performance.</p>
   <p>Especially the Detroit case study highlights the conflicts and contradictions of urban decline. On the one hand, the city seriously experienced and still is experiencing an enormous decline of population and economy. As a reaction on the declining influence of city planning and political strategies, there is a number of initiatives, organizations and movements that exemplify alternative ways of an urban organization and urban economic management (f.e. urban farming projects, "Neighborhood Watch", Clean Downtown, neighborhood initiatives, food cooperations, "humble design"; creative industries, etc.). With publishing the Detroit Strategic Framework Plan "Detroit Future City" in 2013, city responsible ? for the first time in decades of decline ? furthermore offer reasonable and forward thinking solutions on managing Detroit's shrinkage. After a long period of political and societal stagnation, there are approaches to "re:city" Detroit, not following growth centred strategies. However, on the other hand, the case study of Detroit illustrates that ? due to the bankruptcy, the loss of democratic power, the commercialization of alternative ways of urban development (f.e. urban farming and the role of "Hantz Farms"), and especially due to land speculation and the change of real estate property patterns due to so-called "heros" like Dan Gilbert and Michael G. Kelly that owns a very big part of land in Detroit ? Detroit's urban development is basically driven and governed by particular private interests and non-state and thus non-democratic actors. They follow the logic of an on profit based economic management to generate a new growth in Detroit. What happens if a city's development and hope is only based on ambitions and design intentions of only a few largescale enterprises and speculators is already visible in Detroit since the 1970s. Will history repeat itself? </p>

   <p>Given its high rate  of poverty and divestment, Detroit&rsquo;s elected officials and residents are hungry  for new jobs and economic development.?  However, not all large-scale development &ldquo;trickles down&rdquo; to existing  residents and, in some cases, it may even burden host communities, particularly  when accompanied by negative externalities such as heavy traffic, air  pollution, or displacement.? This dynamic  presents a conundrum for residents, community groups, and policy-makers: Is  there a way to promote large-scale economic development that distributes  benefits to the host community?</p>
   <p>??????????? To try to resolve this problem, many  Detroit stakeholders have begun to advocate for a policy tool called a  Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) as a means to mitigate associated harm and  to guarantee local investment associated with new large-scale development.? CBA campaigns have been associated with the  new hockey stadium, the M-1 rail project, Hantz Woodlands, and a new Meijer  grocery store, for example.? In 2013, a  community group that seeks to promote equitable development within the city  began to lobby for citywide legislation that would require developers in  Detroit to negotiate a CBA with host communities in order to do business in the  city.? </p>
??????????? This presentation seeks to not only  contribute to scholarly studies of CBAs and urban power, but also to inform the  work of local groups considering their own CBA campaigns.? In it, I present findings from a three year  (2010 ? 2013) political  ethnographic study in which I traced a Southwest Detroit campaign to secure a  CBA in exchange for hosting a new international border crossing.? Drawing my data from three years of participant  observation, more than seventy in-depth interviews, and an analysis of media  coverage, I demonstrate why and how power dynamics influenced and constrained  this neighborhood group&rsquo;s strategic goals, tactics, and alliances.? I also identify actors who, in some cases  unintentionally, worked to undermine their efforts.? The study provides a cautionary tale about  the power and limitations of CBAs and it demonstrates how economic and  political inequalities are often reinforced in invisible ways.? I conclude with practical suggestions for  community leaders and policy makers to consider in their efforts to redevelop  Detroit as a healthy, sustainable, equitable city.<p>

   <p>Case studies on  language shift and maintenance present contradictory evidence about language  use among immigrant communities in urban areas.?  On the one hand, language shift is presumed to occur quickly, often citing  increased contact with the dominant community language and the need for a  lingua franca.? On the other hand,  language maintenance seems to be fostered in urban areas as there are larger  populations of speakers and often more institutional support for  languages.? To explore this linguistic  puzzle, this presentation will examine the explanatory power of several  different models of language shift by surveying a number of case studies on  historical and contemporary immigrant speech communities in urban areas.? It will then explore the factors which may be  unique to language use among immigrant speakers in urban areas as well as  identify more general processes of shift which can be found in both urban and  rural areas.</p>

    <strong><em>Reclaiming Waawayeyaattanong, or Indigenous Detroit: Reinserting Indigenous Peoples back into Modern Detroit (and Midwestern) History</em></strong><br />

   <p>Indigenous people,  both real and imagined, have been central to settlers&rsquo; development of ideas  about modernity and race in modern Detroit, since the late 19th  century until the present. On August 1, 2009, David Smith, a writer for the <em>WardsAuto</em> magazine, used the Odawa war  chief Pontiac&rsquo;s voice?essentially &ldquo;playing Indian&rdquo;?to help him tell the story  of General Motor&rsquo;s rapid decline during the postwar period, and its movement  from Detroit. For eighty-three years GM took advantage of my name by putting it  on millions of cars?without  sending a single royalty check,&rdquo; wrote Smith. He continued, &ldquo;I can forgive many  transgressions but if I were still a young brave, rather than a relic, I&rsquo;d lead  another siege on Detroit and invade GM&rsquo;s headquarters.&rdquo; In continuing his  diatribe he remarked, &ldquo;As chief of the Ottawas, I had two names. One was  Pontiac, the other Obwandiyag. I only wish GM had adopted the latter.&rdquo;</p>
   <p>     Smith&rsquo;s use of  Pontiac is problematic in many ways. Perhaps key among those problems was  Smith&rsquo;s calling Pontiac a relic, something stuck in the past. Yet it reveals  more than this; it suggests how white men, or masculinity, construct their  sense of self in the modern world through stories about Indigenous peoples.  Importantly, though, Smith&rsquo;s invocation of Pontiac is a part of a larger  historical trajectory of white men using Indigenous peoples to construct their  own idea of self and modernity. Significantly, he chose Pontiac, the man whose  name has remained because a car and a city were named after him. Pontiac has  been the subject of many essays and monographs. He continues to be important  because &ldquo;we have so little evidence of the man.&rdquo;</p>
   <p>     Using critical  discourse analysis of archival materials, this essay analyzes how Pontiac was  used as a foil to white men&rsquo;s ideas about race in Detroit. Located at the  intersection of Detroit&rsquo;s local history, urban history, and Indigenous studies,  this essay reinserts Indigenous presences in Midwestern urban histories, beyond  them as immigrants. This essay makes at least two claims. First, Native  Americans were essential to the development of ideas about race in the late 19th  and early part of 20th century Detroit. Second, though recent urban  histories, especially those in the Midwest, have been important in challenging  the black-white binary, but virtually none have included Native Americans. This  paper suggests, among other things, that we cannot reimagine Detroit without  including its original inhabitants: the Anishinaabek. </p>

                  Wayne State University, Michigan State University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign respectively)</b><br />
                <p>All systems have balances of success and failure, ebbs and flows, positive and negative feedback loops that create equilibrium within their respective ecologies. DETROIT     represents a city in constant flux like no other on the American landscape. Assuming we are all navigating the curve of a success/fail cycle, then what might we observe to be true for Detroit? How can we represent these findings, and of what use are they to the ecology of the city itself?</p>
                <p> The proposed presentation shares the work of DesignInquiry DI), a unique network of thinkers and makers dedicated to furthering the interdisciplinary discourse of design. In February 2014, the DesignInquiry DesignCity project brought together a group of 30 participants to engage the city of Detroit (DI DC D) in an investigation of success/failure cycles and the unexpected ecologies that emerge from these conditions. At 're:the City,' we will present our findings and our exploration into ways to (re)image or (re)imagine the city.</p>
                <p> Specifically, DI DC D will present a collection of artistic works resulting from Design Inquiry's DEPE Space Residency at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD) in October 2014. The residency project is a continuation of our exploration into the city as a space of multifarious opportunity to (re)imagine current possibilities and scenarios.</p>
                <p> In a live, unfolding, interpretation and documentation of the material and findings of our February investigation into Detroit and its systems, the project will comprise the   work of approximately thirty practitioners from art, design, media, design criticism, film, architecture,           landscape architecture, architectural history, urban studies. An intensive broadcast of kaleidoscopic work will be sweetened with audience participation projects, public lectures, workshops, and invited guests. This approach to (re)imagining embraces open-endedness, involves multiple invested participants, and engages public insight.</p>

    <strong><em>Community-Based Pathways to Sustainability for Public and Nonprofit Arts Organizations in Urban Areas</em></strong>
              <p><strong>Alisa Moldavanova</strong><br />
                <strong>Wayne State University </strong></p>
              <p>This paper argues that the sustainability of public and  nonprofit arts organizations is critical to the urban social fabric and  subsequent revitalization of cities. Drawing on relevant bodies of literature  on sustainability and the arts and author's own research, this paper offers a  dimensional model of the arts' impact on individuals and societies, and  connects various dimensions of the arts' impact to sustainability. Among other,  such sustainability can make cities attractive to a critical segment of people:  the creative class. However, such sustainability depends on the ability of arts  organizations to effectively connect with their communities, as well as their  ability to engage in collaborative governance with other actors. The study  investigates the relationship between the level of the social connectedness of  arts organizations and their institutional sustainability. The paper lays out  theoretical propositions regarding the relationship between social  connectedness and sustainability, and suggests the ways to test these  propositions in the context of Detroit.</p><p>

    <strong><em>Reimagining Relocation: Recreating Social Worlds in Older Adulthood</em></strong>

            </strong></p>
              <p>For older adults moving in and around Detroit, relocation may involve recreating social space and social worlds.? Themes of control come into play as moves may be conceptualized as voluntary or involuntary.? As Detroit redefines itself, how are older adults both part of its past, and part of its repopulating and rebuilding?? What will the role of seniors and senior housing be in a reimagined Detroit?? ?</p>
              <p>Considering neighborhood distress and decline in Detroit, Michigan, it is critical to examine relocation in an urban context and its relationship to health and well-being.? Relocation in older adulthood can be fraught with future concerns of autonomy, frailty, and mortality.? While predictive factors of relocation include health and death of a spouse have been established (Wiseman, 1980; Litwak and Longino, 1987), limited attention has been paid to understanding the process of moving in older adulthood, and in particular to analyzing the diverse experiences of older adults.? While moving at any age can be challenging, relocation in later life is a social experience that often involves reconciling one's past, one's possessions and planning for one's future needs (Marcoux, 2001; Luborsky et al., 2012, Perry, 2012).? Identifying the criteria important for a new residence, selection of a residence and the meeting of new neighbors are also part of moving.? This presentation will report on findings from a study aiming to identify the lived experiences of African American elders and their involved kin relocating in this historical moment in our city. This study was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, P30 AG015281, and the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research.            </p>>

    <strong><em>Can Recruiting Immigrants Repopulate the Urban Core? Spatial Assimilation or Reproduction of Gentrification?</em></strong>
      <p><strong>Richard Smith, Theodore Pride, and Catherine Schmitt-Sands<br />
        <b>Wayne State University</b></strong></p>
            <p>Urban space and place continues to undergo social,  economic, and spatial metamorphoses that invite a reimagining of the city. If  Detroit and other declining cities are to experience a renaissance, some policy  makers believe it will involve people repopulating neighborhoods of the urban  core. The literature on urban neighborhood transition since the 1960s primarily  focused on global cities like New York and London and defined gentrification as  the conversion of low-income neighborhoods to relatively more affluent  neighborhoods involving the direct or indirect displacement of the poor. Who  will gentrify declining cities? What will the new racial and class mosaic of  urban space look? </p>
            <p>In the  last 50 years, the U.S. immigrant population has diversified and increased.  Some policy makers have proposed that recruiting high skilled and wealthy  immigrants to promote economic development and revitalize the urban core.  However, some studies have shown a &quot;spatial assimilation&quot; pattern in  which immigrants of different ethnic and racial origins with assimilative  characteristics?possessing the ability to speak English and obtain middle-class  status?are able to live in white and Anglo middle-class spaces. While these  privileged spaces are found in suburban and exurban enclaves, it is also urban  space typically being produced by gentrifiers. Is it possible that the role  played by immigrant groups in the reemergence of the city will be one of a  gentrifier, reproducing existing class and racial arrangements of metropolitan  space, but reconstituted within the central city? Or will immigrant groups  continue to bypass the central city?</p>
              <p>This study seeks to examine neighborhood changes from  1990 to 2010 using normalized Census data from the National Neighborhood Change  Database using standard panel data techniques. If neighborhood immigrant  population is positively associated with English language level, educational  attainment, this supports the spatial assimilation hypothesis. If the  neighborhood immigrant population is positively associated with poverty and  vacancies, but negatively associated with rents, this would support the  gentrification hypothesis. The number of neighborhoods that conform to each  pattern will be displayed with descriptive statistics.Implications  for public policy and further research will be discussed. </p>

    <strong><em>Ending the Neighborhood-to-Prison Pipeline through Restorative Practices in Community and Economic Development</em></strong>
              <p><strong>Kaleema Sumareh<br />
              Wayne State University
            </strong></p>
              <p>The purpose of this paper is to address the theme  of &ldquo;re: the city.&rdquo; ?The paper proposes to  stimulate a thoughtful and provocative discussion on what means to &ldquo;re: the  city,&rdquo; by directly addressing the difficult question of past racial, political,  social and economic conflicts derailing efforts to &ldquo;re&rdquo; the city. &nbsp;This  paper reviews the relevant literature on race and the redevelopment of brown  belt cities and proposes an innovative process for conducting redevelopment  activities, which can effective address issues of race and class  difference.?? </p>
              <p>Some research argues that current residents of  the inner city are more likely to be negatively affected by the redevelopment  of their neighborhoods.? In this paper I  will highlight a discussion of how such development may be correlated or  associated with high incarceration rates of current residents, gentrification  of minority neighborhoods, and the subsequent re-segregation of such urban  centers by clustering largely, affluent whites into those redeveloped neighborhoods.? Such correlates and associations are  problematic for current residents, new comers, developers and government,  though not to equal degrees or for similar reasons.? To address the problematic of race and  redevelopment, I propose an approach for achieving both development and  positive social change based upon principles of Restoration Justice.? Restorative justice is usually associated  with offender and victim mediation in criminal justice and school discipline  settings. &nbsp; </p>
Restorative  justice has the power to address recriminations about past harms, such as  hypersegregation, disinvestment, incarceration and concentrated poverty in a  manner similar to its approach in criminal justice and school discipline.? I suggest that concerns about criminalization  of poor urban residents, rising crime, the school-to-prison pipeline and mass  incarceration have created opportunities and the necessity to rethink redevelopment,  including aggressive policing to achieve crime free, redeveloped  neighborhoods.?? A restorative justice  approach would recognize that &ldquo;crime is a violation of people and of  interpersonal relationships, that those &ldquo;violations create obligations,&rdquo; and  &ldquo;that restoration through repairing the harm makes central the obligation &ldquo;to  put right the wrongs&rdquo; (Zher, 2002). &nbsp; The focus of restorative justice is  not so much punishment of the offender, but through an restorative process,  bring together victim, offender and community to repair the harm done and  restore the community&rsquo;s peace.&nbsp; Restorative  justice practitioners are guided by three questions in their approach putting  right the wrongs: ?&ldquo;who has been hurt,&rdquo;  &ldquo;what are their needs&rdquo; and &ldquo;whose obligations are these&rdquo; (Zher 2002).? These three essential questions are at the  heart of what makes questions of race in redevelopment difficult to bridge.          <p>

   <p>To record anything implies  factuality, a fixity in space and time. To replay a pre-recorded fact, image,  audio also tends to carry such valences of the evidentiary. Yet the ellipses in  time and space between the recording and the playback are inherent to the  process (unless live-streaming). The processes of listening to pre-recorded  material provides a space of reflection; a looking back on, even if the lapsed  time is only a few days or a few years. Yet it is this temporal elision and the  processes of reflection and meaning-making that it elicits that I'd like to  draw attention to and ultimately unsettle with this piece.</p>
   <p> I would like to present an audio  piece that I have compiled from 3 years of recording in and around the city of  Detroit as a practice in deep listening and a possibility to spark conversation  about the broader implications of listening to places. This recording is  grounded in Steven Feld's building upon R. Murray Schafer's theories of  acoustic ecology; finding insight in the non-expository sonic environments in  which we live.</p>
   <p> By highlighting the very processes of  signification; the ways in which meaning is mapped onto landscapes by processes  (that far from the evidentiary) are abstracting in their immediacy, this  project aims to elicit a sensorial engagement with the city. Following John  Cage, this playback of pre-recorded material will mingle with the sounds of the  environment in which it is played, thus indexing the ways in which the past is  always already entangled with the present in the continual unfolding of time.</p>

   <p>There is perhaps no better illustration of the human impulse  to re-shape our circumstances than re-inventing the political, economic,  social, and physical characteristics of cities. In this panel, we offer papers  from political science, sociology, and anthropology that illustrate the ways  that different academic disciplines examine the re-invention of Cities,  particularly in response to dramatic change. Baybeck, Grynaviski, and Uddin  provide a historical perspective to show that today&rsquo;s attempt to re-make  Detroit re-hashes a previously used approach to bankruptcy formulated by a  previous Detroit mayor. Swider considers how African-American women are re-sponding  to the economic crisis in Detroit by re-defining what it means to work.  Finally, Newman contrasts the Detroit of Baybeck et al. and Swider to examine  Paris&rsquo;s attempt at re-invention through the lens of sustainability in <em>post</em>-industrial  France.   </p>
   <p><em><strong>Detroit in fiscal crisis: From the Great  Depression until today</strong></em> <br />
     <strong>Brady Baybeck, Jeffrey Grynaviski, Adam Uddin</strong><br />
     <br />
     A familiar narrative about the Great Depression in the  United States is the role that America's mayors, led by Detroit's Frank Murphy,  played in eliciting support from the General Government for unemployment  relief. That effort began in earnest during the Summer of 1932 when the efforts  of municipal governments and private charities had been finally exhausted,  resulting in Hoover-approved loans for direct relief from the Reconstruction  Finance Corporation--the antecedent to the more recent bailout of the country's  financial institutions. A forgotten part of the narrative is that despite the  federal relief efforts, Detroit and other cities went bankrupt (in the sense of  defaulting on their debts) the following Winter when their financial reserves  were lost to bank failure. Our paper describes how Mayor Murphy led the push to  reform the country's laws so that municipal governments could file for bankruptcy.  We will contrast Detroit's experience in the 1930s with the present to  illustrate the value of cities being able to file for bankruptcy when they are  insolvent. We argue that the response of Detroit's leadership during a past  period of fiscal crisis created the framework that the city is using to address  its current crisis.   </p>
   <p><em><strong>Re-thinking  Detroit&rsquo; economy: African American Women and their work in Detroit&rsquo;s informal  economy</strong></em><strong>.?<br />Sarah Swider</strong><br /> 
     <br />
     Detroit is struggling with long-term structural changes like  deindustrialization coupled with the recent economic crisis. One significant  and enduring consequence of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession  has been intractable unemployment rates that we have seen across the nation.  Despite the fact that declining opportunities in formal employment forces  people into informal work, informal work has been given little attention by  researchers. Detroit had an official unemployment rate of 27% at the end of  2009, with alternative estimates placing it somewhere between 44 and 50%. While  there has been some improvement in the employment figures since 2009, the  reality remains that more than half of the city&rsquo;s population has turned to  other forums of employment beyond the formal economy for survival in the city. <br />
     <br />
     There is an assumption that these people are either living  off the state or engaged in illegal activities. However, this overlooks the  vibrant and growing informal economy, which not only provides primary income  for many people, but also supplements their incomes from other sources. In an  effort to provide a better understanding of the Detroit economy, this paper  explores Detroit&rsquo;s informal economy with a focus on African American women in  Detroit who participate in informal work in one of two sectors of the service  industry: childcare and beauty services. In this paper, informal work is  defined as all legal and remunerated economic activity conducted outside of  state regulation in terms of taxes, social welfare and labor law. Based on  primary data, this paper looks at how these industries have changed over time,  why and when women turn to informal work/employment, and what are some of the  benefits and burdens of these arrangements.   </p>
<p><em><strong>Green  infrastructure and the right to the city: Perspectives on urban reinvention  gleaned from the sustainable remaking of post-industrial France</strong></em><strong>.<br />Andrew Newma</strong>n<br /> 
  </p>
In post-industrial cities around the world, disused  infrastructure and shuttered factories are often repurposed as sustainable  urban designs, and in particular, parks and green spaces. This presentation  draws on ethnographic work conducted in and around Paris to demonstrate how  reinvented post-industrial districts are imagined as part of a new form of  &ldquo;green infrastructure&rdquo; that is vital to the city&rsquo;s global competitiveness. Such  green infrastructure have become important sites: for the ecological  amelioration of post-industrial urban zones; the production of an aura of  sustainability closely tied to the reinvention of the city&rsquo;s identity and brand  image; and as the focal point for competing claims over what Lefebvre called  the &ldquo;right to the e city.&rdquo; Various constituencies and actors including  planners, politicians, and neighborhood-based groups contest, negotiate and  redefine the meaning of &ldquo;sustainability,&rdquo; nature, the &ldquo;environment,&rdquo; and  &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; through a process of reinvention in ways that are often inflected  by class, gender, and ethnicity.? Special  attention will be paid to points of inspiration, as well as potential lessons  to be learned for Detroit.

   <p>Detroit has long been identified as a city in decline.  Although there are signs that the city is beginning to recover, such as the  fledgling renaissance in Midtown, the damage that has been done to the city's  physical environment and identity will take decades to heal. The process of  recovery will require not only a significant improvement of the local economy  and infrastructure, but also the revision or reinvention of the city's  narrative about itself. Our group, Ethnic Layers of Detroit, proposes to contribute  to the (re-?)creation of this narrative by investigating and documenting some  of the little-known community stories that comprise the overlapping ethnic and  cultural layers of the city's vibrant history. An important part of this  new(er) narrative is its attempt to be more complete and comprehensive than the  current one. Too much of Detroit's history has been forgotten, hidden, or  overshadowed by its current problems. Our project will reintroduce Detroit to  itself by exploring the stories told by its buildings, sites, and monuments and  their intersection with international history and culture. These stories will  ultimately be freely available in an app. The juncture of the old (ethnic layers  of the city) and the modern (digital storytelling) creates a space for  interaction with history in the virtual world while encouraging real, physical  explorations of the city. We believe that such exploration will, in turn, lead to new connections, new assessments, and new, more dynamic  narratives about Detroit.</p>
