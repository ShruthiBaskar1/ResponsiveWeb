           <b>English, Distinguished Professor. <em>The San Dominque Slave Rebellion and Feminist Reform in John Thelwall's &quot;The Daughter of Adoption&quot;</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> I have co-edited a scholarly edition of John Thelwall's 1801 novel, The Daughter of Adoption, recently published by Broadview Press.  In my paper I will concentrate on two aspects of the novel, how the representation of the Saint Domingue slave rebellion functions in relation to the overall feminist theme, embodied in the novel's heroine Seraphina. Aristocratic male sexuality and social privilege are represented as forms of domination, not just of working-class women and enslaved women but also of upper-class women, like the protagonist Henry's mother.  The novel contrasts the predatory sexuality of the privileged males with the female-centered educational reforms of the &quot;petticoat philosophers&quot; like Anna Barbauld.  The popularized representation of the Saint Domingue rebellion emphasized black male violence against whites, especially white women.  Thelwall subverts these racist misrepresentations by writers like Bryan Edwards and Baron de Wimpffen in a number of ways:  the slave rebellion itself, despite the sexual violence, is aligned with the French Revolution; the violence of the rebels is depicted as discriminatory rather than merely vengeful; the plantation elite are seen as far crueler than the rebelling slaves.  Moreover, the novel's sensationalistic images of slaves raping white women?images made iconic by writers like Edwards?are countered by numerous other images of white domination, exploitation, and injustice.  The overall plot hinges on the moral reformation of the aristocratic male hero, Henry, who will not be allowed to marry Seraphina until he adopts fully the cultural values of revolutionary feminism. </p>

<b>Abstract:</b> This lecture will begin with a brief description of The Graduate School at WSU. The presentation will move from there to a broad discussion of graduate education at WSU, including an overview of changes in graduate education across the country with specific attention to assorted calls to "reinvent" graduate study. There are a number of "hot button" issues all faculty (and graduate students) need to consider in the coming years. These include: the definition of graduate study, the distinction between and MA and a PhD, alternative-academic careers, enrollment, data management, and other important topics. </p>

<b>Abstract:</b> In this presentation, Professor Kruman will discuss the public responsibilities of public higher education and examine how the development of &quot;citizenship across the curriculum&quot; can enable universities to fulfill those responsibilities by educating thoughtful, knowledgeable citizens for a lifetime of civic commitment.  Current research indicates that the adoption of such a revised curriculum also will have practical results: it will foster improved recruitment, retention, and graduation rates; enhance job skills and strengthen corporate citizenship when those graduates enter the work force. </p>

<b>English Department and Linguistics Program, Professor and Director. <em>Detroit's Language Evolution and Linguistic Fossils: How Humans Spoke at the Dawn of Language, and Why our Grammars still Preserve "Fossils" of such Speech </em></b><br />
<b>Abstract:</b> It is widely acknowledged that we live in a increasingly visual world and yet knowledge concerning visual information continues to lag behind that of the printed or spoken word among the general population. This new visual paradigm, driven in large part by technological developments enabling the easy exchange and display of images, has brought into sharper focus the lack of knowledge and training concerning visual information. As access to visual information is largely dependent on the descriptive information associated with an image, there is a critical need to perform this work well. This study examines the development of visual literacy skills among library and information science students. Their progress is traced through a series of exercises and learning tools developed to increase their understanding of visual information and the unique challenges of producing descriptive metadata for images. The findings of the study point to several general patterns of visual literacy development as well as revealing the high degree of frustration experienced by the students in their attempts to perform the work.</p>

          <b> Film and Media Studies English Department, Assistant Professor.<em> Vulgar Boredom: On Time, Detachment, and Some  Boring Films by Andy Warhol and Christopher Nolan  </em></b><br />
          <b>Abstract:</b> Philosophers of boredom such as Heidegger and Agamben have tended to theorize a split in boredom, between a vulgar boredom arising from everyday life under capitalism or modernity, and an authentic, profound boredom, a path philosophy. This split is mirrored in the critical discourse on Warhol. Works like his serial silkscreens, or Empire and his other early &quot;stillies&quot; - these are good-boring, commenting on the bad-boring of ordinary commodity objects and deadening mass culture. <br/><br/>In this paper, I consider Warhol's profoundly-boring Kiss (1963) alongside Christopher Nolan's vulgar-boring blockbuster Inception (2010). To be sure, many found Nolan's film captivating; my own boredom is rather data for a phenomenological and psychoanalytical theorization of boredom as an affective and aesthetic disposition for film viewers. What happens when we watch boring media? And why should we want to do so? <br /><br/> Using psychoanalyst Thomas Ogden's scheme of psychic positions, I argue that boredom as aesthetic response belongs to the depressive position, marked by a sense of distance from the world. This depressive distance is itself ambivalent, as it can lead either the possibility of aesthetically redeemed profound boredom, attended by critical or interpretive distance; or, it entails the slackened, alienated, and affectively reparative vulgar boredom. </p>

          <b> Political Science, Associate Professor &amp; MPA Director; Political Science, Doctoral Student.  <em>Power to the Powerless? Adopting District Representation In Detroit </em></b><br />
          <b>Abstract:</b> In November 2009, voters in the City of Detroit, Michigan, passed Proposal D by a nearly 3 to 1 margin. This initiative changed the structure of representation in the city from a nine-member city council elected at-large to a hybrid system with seven districts and two at-large. <br /> <br />Although one could certainly argue that the city had bigger issues to deal with, this new form of representation indicated a break from 100 years of stability in governmental structure. Thus it is worthwhile to examine why this proposal made it on the ballot and why it passed so easily. In this paper, we focus on the latter question, examining the factors that led to the successful election outcome. We find that passage of this proposal was in some sense inevitable ? there were many factors that pointed in the direction of a move to district representation. This finding runs somewhat contrary to the conventional wisdom, which argues that success came from a well-run campaign that reached out to the various constituencies of the city. <br/><br/>This suggests that the process of getting on the ballot is more important than the actual campaign and election ? that, in cities like Detroit, it is the agenda-setting that drives the process.          </p>

  <strong><u>September 25 - Robert Ackerman</u></strong> <br />
  <b> Law School,  Professor. <em>Corporate Communitarianism </em></b><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> The United States Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission 558 U.S. 310 (2010) held that a federal statute, 2 U.S.C.A. ? 441(b) (2002), restricting corporate and labor union expenditures to defeat a candidate for office could not withstand first amendment scrutiny. While applauded by an unusual coalition of first amendment absolutists and conservative politicians, the decision has been derided by advocates of election reform and liberal critics, including the President of the United States.  <br />
  <br />
  Largely overlooked in this discussion have been the implications of Citizens United for corporate law, and in particular, the extent to which state corporate law permits for-profit business corporations to use corporate funds to engage in political discourse and activities. By declaring that corporations (and unions) have first amendment rights coextensive with those of other citizens and ascribing &quot;personhood&quot; to corporations, the Court majority may have (albeit inadvertently) trumped state corporate laws and behaviors that narrowly restrict the scope of corporate conduct to the maximization of shareholder profits.  And the Citizens United decision may have provided encouragement to communitarians who, given our belief that rights imply responsibilities, will urge that there now remains little excuse for corporations to deny accountability to constituencies beyond their shareholders.  Unfortunately, it may have also given license to corporate officers who might view the corporate fisc as a means of financing their own political beliefs and aspirations, to the detriment of other corporate constituencies. <br />
  <br />
  Together with Professor Lance Cole of Penn State University's Dickinson School of Law, I am exploring how Citizens United may have not only reordered the law pertaining to corporate speech, but further weakened the &quot;shareholder wealth maximization&quot; theory of corporate activity.  We will consider the evolving role of corporations (from the early days of the Ford Motor Company to the &quot;Don't Be Evil&quot; philosophy of Google) along with the potentially benign effect of cases expanding the free speech rights of corporations and unions. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Living Cities is an innovative philanthropic
collaborative of 22 of the world's largest
foundations and financial institutions with a
broad, ambitious mission: to improve the
lives of low-income people and the cities
where they live. It began as a quite different
organization in 1991 as the National
Community Development Initiative (NCDI),
a uniquely lean, distinctively-governed effort
to accomplish a tightly targeted goal ? to
take the emerging movement of community
development corporations (CDCs) to scale --
and then "go out of business." It is a
remarkable example of social innovation and
adaptation in the nonprofit sector, and its
work has touched Detroit in all three phases
of its evolution, currently as the national
funder of the Woodward Corridor Initiative.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Healthcare NGOs working in indigenous language
communities are in a unique position to serve as allies
in language maintenance and revitalization efforts. On
one hand, there is evidence providing care in a
patient's first language improves health outcomes
(Aranguri and Ramirez 2006). On the other hand,
healthcare NGOs work in a high-status domain of
language use important for language revitalization
(Heinze Balcazar 2012).</p>
            <p> In this talk I report on the work of Wuqu' Kawoq, a nongovernmental health organization that was founded in 2007 with the explicit mission of bridging the quality in health care divide for indigenous Kaqchikel Maya communities by developing health care services and programs delivered natively in the Kaqchikel language. Through a series of case studies, we develop an argument for more closely tying language      maintenance and revitalization to the development agenda. The conclusion is that linguists should pursue broader partnerships when seeking to do work in minority language communities.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula from approximately 1808 to 1814 had major consequences for Spain and its American colonies.  The French occupation forces toppled Spanish King Ferdinand VII, triggering a popular outcry characterized by the formation of juntas or governing bodies that sought to rule on behalf of the deposed monarch.  Eventually, the regional assemblies created a Supreme Junta and later a Council of Regency that in 1810 took the unprecedented step of summoning delegates from the metropolis and Spanish America to a parliamentary meeting known as the Cortes Generales y Extraordinarias.  Besieged by the stalking enemy and under pressure to build a broad coalition that might preserve the disarticulated empire in 1812 the joint assembly adopted a liberal constitution that remained in effect on and off during the first four decades of the 19th century, specifically between 1812-14, 1820-23, and 1836-37.  This presentation explores two specific moments?1812 and 1838?when constitutional decision-making and/or the liberal thinking it unleashed-- impacted on the future viability of servile labor regimes in Spanish colonial Puerto Rico.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will share the insights from having edited a special segment on self publishing in Against the Grain. Self publishing has become increasingly respectable for both commercial and scholarly purposes as the new found popularity of ebooks has opened up markets for aspiring authors and scholars. The astounding success of 50 Shades of Gray shows how a self published book can go main stream with enormous financial rewards for its author. Self publishing is also an alternative for serious scholarly works that do not have the sales potential that university presses and trade publishers increasingly demand. Established companies such as Amazon and newer start-ups like Smashwords simplify the process and provide guidance through all the steps of getting published, though often at a price. The author can retain complete control or contract out for services. But is self publishing really this simple? Perhaps, but authors have to be prepared to look at their manuscripts in the same way as a publisher would, to market their own works, and to overcome the problems of being outside the traditional distribution system including difficulties in selling to libraries. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> In this  lecture-recital, Profs. Roelofs and Conway will speak about the challenges of  editing music from a composer's manuscript scores, and they will perform three  short unpublished works by Charles Martin Loeffler (1861-1947).&nbsp; Loeffler  was a virtuoso violinist who went on to become one of the most celebrated  American composers of his day but has now fallen into  near-obscurity.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Many questions arose in the process of editing these  works:&nbsp; What was their original purpose?&nbsp; Who may have performed  them? How sacrosanct is the manuscript as the composer wrote it -- how do we  decide whether a note or chord is intentional or an error?&nbsp; Would Loeffler  have approved of us re-discovering and performing these pieces?&nbsp; What  value do they have now?&nbsp; While working to bring these scores to life,  carefully deciphering the composer's handwriting and his own corrections and  additions, there was a distinct sensation of &quot;co-composing&quot; as he  looked over our shoulders;&nbsp; hence the title Playing With Ghosts.  <font color="#990000"><strong>(Schaver Recital Hall, Old Main)</strong></font></p>

           <b>Art and Art History, Associate Professor. <em>Culture, Costume and the Bourgeois in Paul Delaroche's Portraits of Protestants</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b>This paper examines the slippages between
individuality and religious or class identification
in Paul Delaroche's portraits of Protestant men
from the 1840s. The rise of the bourgeoisie during
the July Monarchy has been widely linked to both
the explosive growth of portraiture and the
"triumph of black" in men's fashion in the 1830s
and 1840s. Critical debates about the role of
portraiture emerged with new intensity at the
Salon of 1833, which also provided the first
public exhibition of Ingres's Louis-Fran?ois
Bertin, a portrait that July Monarchy critics
characterized as an iconic representation of
bourgeois masculinity. In this paper, I examine
the tensions that emerge from Delaroche's
emulation of Ingres and contemporary fashion, his
effort to individualize his sitters, and his adoption
of an austere aesthetic that embodied values
associated with both the bourgeois and the
Protestant.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Objectives: In this talk Professor Brewster will
elaborate on a line of research that is only in its
infancy stages of development and yet is ripe with
opportunities to advance our understanding of the
effects of consumer discrimination on racial
earnings inequities among tip dependent employees
in the United States. Methods. Brewster will analyze
data derived from a large exit survey of restaurant
consumers (n=378) in an attempt to replicate,
extend, and further explore the recently documented
effect of service providers' race on consumers'
tipping decisions. Results. He finds that both White
and Black restaurant customers discriminate against
Black servers by tipping them less than their White
coworkers.<br /><br />
Further, Professor Brewster finds no evidence that
this Black tip penalty is the result of interracial
differences in service skills possessed by Black and
White servers. Conclusion. Racial discrimination in
tipping is a salient source of economic racial
inequality that has been overlooked by most
scholars. As such, Brewster will conclude this talk
by delineating directions for future research. </p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> All states in the United States have established programs for identifying elderly victims of abuse, as well as for providing services to alleviate such abuse. Michigan, like most states, has established a program requiring the Mandatory Reporting of Elder Abuse, which requires professionals who provide services to the elderly to report suspected cases of abuse to a division of State government. Dr. Sengstock received a grant from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan in 2006-08 to conduct interviews with the service providers who provide services under the Mandatory<br />
           Reporting law. The purpose of the study was to obtain these professionals' perspectives on the effectiveness of the process as it was operating in Michigan. Those interviewed included both professionals who are listed as required reporters, and those in State agencies who are responsible for receiving and responding to the reports. The study uncovered a number of problems which interfere with the effectiveness of the process. This presentation will discuss some of these issues.

           <b>CMLLC, Associate Professor. <em>Michelangelo Antonioni and the Ecology of Form </em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> In making <em>Deserto rosso</em> [<em>Red Desert</em>, 1964], Michelangelo Antonioni's first color film, the director's friend and biographer Carlo di Carlo recalls his obsession with a color temperature meter, which helped him to determine the relationship between material objects, rays of light, and humidity. Color, which many critics recognize as one of the protagonists of this formally elegant film, exists as a complicated function of material realities (often plastic and industrial in the Italy of the economic boom), shifting object relationships, and viewer perspectives. Through its obsessive focus on color as narrative<br />
           driver and as formal abstraction, <em>Red Desert</em>, with its steaming factories, polluted shipping channels, and<br />
           foggy riverbanks, vividly stages its own composition as a collaboration between human and nonhuman<br />
           agencies. Taking a material ecocritical approach, this paper ponders the encounters of liquid, color, and<br />
           cinema and the ways that their meeting destabilizes <em>Red Desert</em>, and arguably Antonioni's very status as auteur.</p>

           <b>Art and Art History, Assistant Professor. <em>The Authenticity of Multiples</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract: </b>Our sense of an artwork's cultural and commodity value is tied to a wish for authenticity. And authenticity is still easily, instinctively felt to reside in an art object, perhaps especially so in the case of sculpture. Just as instinctively, this can be thought of as making simple economic sense ? uniqueness or rarity can be factors establishing value. Given this, at first consideration multiples risk an impression of inauthenticity -- imperfect, inadequate, shadows of an idealized original.</p>
   <p>However, sculpture's embrace of the multiple is also entirely natural from a material and technical perspective. The practice of sculpture over the course of its history has proceeded as a part of new<br />
     developments in object making and building. Such developments bring new opportunity to sculpture and<br />
     add to the methodologies at its disposal. Rather than avoid the multiple, artists who embrace it as a condition of their practice add particular kinds of authenticity to their work unachievable in the lone object or small edition. I will discuss an &quot;authenticity of multiples,&quot; and its value in my own work, with considerations of historical precedent and contemporary practice in sculpture.</p>

     <b>English, Associate Professor. <em>Playing (on) the Self: Claude Cahun and the <br />
       Aesthetics of Un/Becoming </em></b><br />
     <b>Abstract:</b> French photographer and writer Claude Cahun (1894-1950) cuts an unruly figure in the context of literary criticism and art history. While considered odd, obscene, a genius nonetheless, at the time she created her bestknown works, in more recent years, Cahun has been associated with High Modernism and Surrealism, or, alternatively, claimed for an affirmative (feminist) gender politics.<br/>
     <br/>
     Rather than argue against such, in my view, reductive approaches, what I will do in this paper is reflect upon the interplay of aesthetics and affect in Cahun's recalcitrant faux autobiography Aveux non avenus<br />
     (1930), and in her photographic self-stagings, to expose the mobility, the proliferous, and mercurial nature of a self that is never one, and never once and for all, but, instead, a continuously shifting configuration of fragments and collages without any claim to truth, seriousness, and authenticity. I will further indicate the ways in which her works do not so much represent &quot;anything&quot; but rather effect an alternative mode of relating (to self, to the world, to art) that defies both the parameters of scientific reason, identity politics, art (historical) aesthetics, and political nihilism.</p>

           <b>Abstract: </b>In France, the end of the 1960s was marked by a reexamination of consumer society. Georges Perec's work Things: a history of the 1960s, speaks to this point. Perec describes a young couple whose only happiness comes from purchasing, or wanting to purchase, high-end consumer goods. In this presentation we will analyze how this couple, representative of a certain categorie of the French population, is disillusioned by the myth of the society of abundance and excluded from the dream of attaining happiness through extreme consumer spending. Their exclusion can be explained both by economic and social reasons.<br />
           <br />
             The characters will first be examined from the economic perspective in the light of the thinkers Herbert Marcuse and Jean Baudrillard. Bourdieu's work La Distinction will then be used to analyse the class structure of the lower middle classes working in newly developed professions, notably in the field of advertising, hence explaining how Perec's characters are unable to achieve their dream of social<br />
            climbing. In conclusion, we see that although the deck is stacked against them from the beginning, Jerome and Sylvie contribute to their own exclusion by their passivity and their bad personal choices.</p>

           <b>Sociology, Visiting Professor. <em>The Effect of Inter-Regional Migration to Regional Economy Disparity in China</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> China's initiation of economic reform in 1978 along with a more  open policy towards the global economy, has led to massive internal migration.  Most of these migrants are Chinese peasants who have moved from the countryside  to large coastal cities. This massive migration has resulted in profound  changes in China's  economic development and social structures. This paper explores the effects of  this massive migration on regional economy disparity.</p>
            <p>Neo-classical economics suggests that the process of  migration works to narrow economic disparity. In contrast,&nbsp;new economics of migration and  dual-labor market theory complicate the picture and suggest that migration,  depending on the conditions, could narrow or widen&nbsp;regional economy disparity. This paper  uses the interesting case of China,  to explore the impacts of migration, specifically inter-regional migration, on  economic disparity.&nbsp; The study uses the Chinese national census and sample  survey to analyze labor migration trends and characteristics of these migrants  which is then used to analyze changes in regional economies. Results indicate  that the inter-regional migration is helpful in improving national economy  growth and narrowing regional economy disparity, and it suggests this is due to  the more efficient allocation of labor. Furthermore, these findings support  further elimination of institutional obstacles that are impeding labor mobility.</p>

He became Detroit's first African-American mayor in the same week that Maynard Jackson (1938- 2003) became the first African-American mayor of Atlanta. Over the years Young and his policies have drawn responses of all kinds ranging from the creative to the critical. Among these is an unusual poster that is signed by an artist named 'Regina' and dated 1986. Using word and image the poster pairs Mayor Young with the Athenian politician and statesman Pericles (c.495-429 B.C.).

           <b>Abstract:</b> China's rapid economic development relies on massive migration from rural to urban areas. This new migrant workforce is generally associated with the rise of export-oriented manufacturing and the &quot;Made-in-China&quot; label. However, a majority end up working in China's growing cities in the informal economy, concentrated in the service sector and construction industry. This raises two important inter-related questions that this talk will explore, &quot;Are these migrants part of a new working class?&quot; and, &quot;How does this new large segment of informal workers shape the possibility of an independent labor movement developing in China?&quot;</p>

           <b>Abstract: </b>&quot;Collective action problems&quot; have been examined by numerous authors, including the<br />
           anthropologist Mary Douglas and the Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom, frequently using similar touchstones (such as &quot;the tragedy of the commons,&quot;) yet with little apparent awareness of the findings or insights of disciplines other than their own.<br />
           <br />
    This article examines the unique role of technology in shaping collective action problems, suggesting that technologies create sociality: the means of production are also means of connection. The importance of autonomous representations for defining technologies create new forms of sociality that experience new problems of collective action, illustrated by newer commons such as airspace, radio frequency spectrum, or the &quot;friend&quot;-ships of social media. The ongoing technological dramas that resolve<br />
    these boundary disputes are described.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Though the cultural and linguistic complexity of Lebanon is similar to Morocco, the contested definitions of identity, nationalism and Arabization are different. There are internal and external forces that set the stage for the appearance of new national identities in both countries. To understand Lebanon of today and the place of language in constructing its national identity, it is vital to delve into its history. The major conflict in Lebanon is fundamentally two notions of self-definition, the one based on language and the other based on religion. The battle of linguistically and religiously constructed identities is fought on several fronts. In Morocco, however, the main conflict is mainly about language. The Arabization policy which has been adopted in Morocco is a re-affirmation of national identity which has been obscured for years by the French colonization. The implementation of this policy is viewed as a<br />
           top-down policy. It stimulates oppositional identity that rejected pan-Arabism as a focal point for national pride. The new dynamics of political and cultural transformations that Morocco has recently experienced have led to the revitalization of new definitions of national identity. Taking a comparative<br />
           approach, this study seeks to demonstrate contested definitions of Arabization, nationalism and identity in Lebanon and Morocco.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> Is it possible to imagine a &quot;post-global&quot; era? The journal <em>Science Fiction Studies</em> ?following Suma Gupta's concept of &quot;imaginative representations of globalization&quot; ? recently dedicated a special issue (November 2012) to explore how contemporary Science Fiction offers innovative approaches to study globalization. Although, the study of globalization may seem to be over explored, the special issue of <em>Science Fiction Studies</em> is relevant and important because it postulates new possibilities to theorize globalization from an imaginative and speculative perspective. With this in mind, this presentation will offer a look into global networks, cyberspace and digital technologies from the peripheral gaze of a Mexican peasant on the verge of becoming a cyborg and <em>n??b</em> or novice hacker. In order to conceptualize this idea, the presentation will propose Alex Rivera's <em>Sleep Dealer</em> (2009) not as a cyberpunk film <em>per se</em>, but as an example of post-cyberpunk aesthetics for the 21st century. Furthermore, the presentation will argue that the low-tech cyborg-hacker character is an information age <em>p?caro</em> that offers a 2.0 <em>testimonio</em> version to share an alternate reality of information and communication technologies from the liminal time and space of the global digital divide.</p>

            <b>Abstract: </b>Mathematical prescriptivism is a systematic language ideology found in school mathematics that uses a discourse of rationality to approve or disapprove of language forms based on their perceived logicality. The present study is based on a three-year ethnographic investigation of the Math Corps, a mathematical community of practice based in Detroit, in which mathematical prescriptivism is used both to highlight algorithms seen as beneficial and to build social solidarity. Although motivated by the analogy with English spelling reform, prescriptivism at Math Corps must avoid potentially harmful criticism of students or their cognitive capacities, of the sort often experienced by African American students in school settings. A playful linguistic frame, the prescriptive melodrama, is identified and discussed as a means of teaching prescriptions, thereby enculturating students into the locally preferred register, the 'Math Corps way', which encompasses social, moral, and mathematical practices as well as linguistic norms.</p>

           <b>Abstract: </b>Modern Standard Arabic is as ambiguous a term as multi-layered the structures of the language are.

Understanding these mental images and determining the functions of Modern Standard Arabic will help us to both identify the structural make-up of Modern Standard Arabic and its degree of variation.</p>

           <b>Anthropology, Assistant Professor. <em>Tasting and Judging the Unknown Terroir of the Bulgarian Wine: The Plitical Economy of Sensory Experience</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> While Bulgaria may not be immediately associated as a major wine producing country for global consumers, it built a large wine industry during the socialist era and used wine as one of the country's major export commodity. To cope with the changing market environment in the aftermath of state socialism, Bulgarian wine industry has been undergoing a significant transformation. Some Bulgarian winemakers insist that their unique terroir (taste of place) and native grapes can deliver a &quot;distinctive&quot; product in the global market. Such beliefs are the driving force for marginal producers to continue with their wine production in a fiercely competitive global wine market despite the lack of brand equity and cultural capital compared to the world's elite wines. How can the global consumer sense this unique &quot;taste of place&quot; which is itself an elusive culturally cultivated concept? What does gastronomic connoisseurship entail in a highly globalized world where knowledge of local products and taste are<br />
           exchanged and experienced in a standardized way as a global foodway? Understanding these questions from the viewpoints of the Bulgarian wine sector, this talk discusses the intersection of the sensory experience and the implicit global hierarchy of value that wine producers and consumers employ<br />
           to objectify and communicate the subjective taste knowledge and identity of place.</p>

  <b>Sociology,<em> Religion, Race, and Partisanship in America</em></b><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> Using the 2004-2008 National Politics Study, our study suggests that religion does not uniformly associate with political leanings across racial/ ethnic lines. Among Whites, the relationship<br />
  between religion and political leanings is partially explained by views of patriotism and racial inequality. White Evangelicals tend to identify with Republicans and conservatives because they tend to adopt less critical views of patriotism and an individualistic interpretation of racial inequality. Even when such views are accounted for, attending worship services is associated with conservative political leanings among<br />
  Whites. Conversely, Non-Evangelicals and attendees of political congregations tend to identify with Democrats and liberals because they tend to adopt more critical views of patriotism and a structural interpretation of racial inequality. In contrast, religion is largely unrelated to Hispanic and African American political leanings. And, the extent to which we observe a relationship, views about patriotism and racial inequality play a marginal explanatory role.

           <b>Abstract:</b> Malcolm X was highly critical of the United States political system. As a result, his reflex position was to be sympathetic to challenges to American power. In the post- World War II period, the Cuban Revolution represented the most important defeat of American imperialism in the Western hemisphere. In 1960, Malcolm X met with Fidel Castro at a famous meeting at the Theresa Hotel in Harlem. This positive meeting reinforced Malcolm X's sympathy for the Cuban Revolution.</p>

              young Afro-Cuban resident in New York City, who supported Malcolm X and the dramatic changes in his<br />
              homeland. In 1960, Moore returned to Cuba to work for the Revolution and two years later escaped Cuba. By the time that Carlos Moore left Cuba and denounced the Revolution, Malcolm X had left the Nation of Islam and entered a period of political transition. In1964, Malcolm X met with Carlos Moore in Paris, France. Malcolm X later asked Moore to become involved in his new political organization, the OAAU, and open an office in Paris. Moore, in exile, still greatly admired Malcolm X and agreed to work with him. Unfortunately, Malcolm X was denied access to France in 1965 and unable to meet again with Moore to discuss their political futures.</p>

           The Moderating Role of Neighborhood Cultural Context<br />
           </em>Abstract: </b>Research investigating the degree to which an 'oppositional culture' among minority students may have deleterious consequences for academic achievement has provided substantial insight into the links between student attitudes and educational outcomes. However, this research has generally ignored the broader contexts of students' social environments by operationalizing culture using individual level measures of attitudes. As a result, scholars know relatively little about how broader neighborhood cultural context shapes academic achievement, how neighborhood cultural context conditions the association between individual level orientations toward schooling and academic<br />
           achievement, or how these processes vary by race. This study examines the role of neighborhood cultural heterogeneity in shaping academic achievement. Results from national data indicate that neighborhood cultural heterogeneity plays an important role in conditioning the effects of individual orientations on academic achievement and that the moderating effects of cultural contexts vary by race. Results show that Black students are more likely to translate their positive orientations toward schooling into high achievement in the context of more culturally heterogeneous neighborhoods, whereas white and Hispanic student tend to fare worse in such environments. The research underscores the importance of taking into account the context of students' lives for understanding the<br />
           relationship between individual student orientations and academic achievement.</p>

           <b>Abstract: </b>In recent decades, historians have become increasingly interested in spatial as well as temporal analysis, and in the relationship between space and time in historical narrative. Most conceptual and theoretical frameworks for spatial analysis, however, come out of other disciplines (most importantly, geography). Historians tend to use the terms space and place interchangeably, and without much attention to the empirical or theoretical work produced by social scientists. This presentation seeks to integrate historians' attentiveness to the particularities of local place with geographers' and sociologists' interest in the more generalizable politics of space. Drawing on research on urban policy in the US and postindustrial redevelopment schemes for Pittsburgh since 1968, the talk reconstructs how boosters and policymakers imagined the urban future, and how they worked to inscribe their social, cultural, and economic visions in urban space. In their efforts to confront so-called urban crises, the political and business elites who heavily influenced national and local public policy considered only a narrow set of possibilities for urban redevelopment, which were premised on a common grammar of postindustrial transformation and on urban policies that privatized public space and decentralized public services.</p>

           <b>Abstract: </b>In the wake of the economic crisis in 2007, many local municipal governments are facing a variety of financial challenges. Scholars and practitioners call for citizen participation in various parts of government; however, it is unclear how efforts to engage the public can be sustained when municipalities undergo tough financial times. This research explores the impact of internal and external factors?(1) the fiscal crisis itself, measured both subjectively and objectively, (2) internal and environmental complexity, and (3) administrative decentralization?on whether citizens are given the resources and opportunity to be involved in decision-making related to the fiscal crises. Findings suggest that, despite their concerns for the diminishing fiscal capacity, local governments support public participation in governing processes. Internal complexity in local government also has a positive impact on public involvement and resource provision. Lastly, the analyses indicate mixed findings for environmental complexity faced by local jurisdictions.</p>

In this presentation, I look at the poem &ldquo;through&rdquo; Grendel&rsquo;s eyes, vividly described as glowing &ldquo;with a hideous light, most like a flame.&rdquo; Grendel&rsquo;s glowing eyes are, literally and figuratively, a lens through which to view the intersection of the human and animal, the rationality of virtue and the irrationality of sin; they belong equally to demonic and fantastical creatures (often described as having glowing eyes) and to iconographies of destructive rage. Both his eyes and Grendel himself thus offer a way of looking at how extremes of emotion threaten the stability both of individual identity and society. Understanding the visualization of anger in early English writing can help us better understand histories of emotion, as well as the terms in which we discuss or experience emotional phenomena.</p>

           <b>Abstract:</b> <strong>ArtsCorpsDetroit</strong> grew out of remarkable student service-learning projects, and interest among faculty in three colleges (Education; Fine, Performing and Communication Arts; and Honors) to promote art based service-learning for students, faculty and community art programs. The 50th<br />
           anniversary of the Peace Corps in 2010 seemed a fitting time to establish <strong>ArtsCorpsDetroit</strong> as a community program of Wayne State whose mission to enhance individual growth, enrich the community and contribute to the vibrancy and well being of the City of Detroit is achieved through four strategies: service-learning, research, a volunteer corps, and public programming.<br />
           <br />
           This presentation will describe the service-learning and volunteer strategies of <strong>ArtsCorpsDetroit</strong>, and summarize the data collected to date in six courses, from nine community agency directors, constituents of three agencies, and alumni of service learning courses 2008-2010. The presentation will focus especially on students' experiences: how service-learning fosters academic learning, diversity learning, intra- and interpersonal learning, social responsibility learning as well as a reinvigoration of passion for their professions. Emerging evidence that art based service-learning encourages self-determination and<br />
           connections between individual and community health are explored.</p>

           <b>Music, Professor. <em>Brazeal Dennard: Cultural Impact of Spirituals</em></b><strong><font color="#FF0000"> <u>(held at the Schaver Music Recital Hall, Old Main)</u></font></strong><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> Brazeal Dennard (1929-2010), who worked tirelessly to promote and preserve the works of African-American musicians through coalition building and social entrepreneurship in the arts, left behind a rich musical legacy in Detroit including the founding of the Brazeal Dennard Chorale in 1972, and the cofounding of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra's Classical Roots concert series in 1978. Both entities are steeped in the traditions of African-American music and evidenced most notably in the spiritual. When speaking of spirituals Dennard remarked, &quot;I am two generations removed from slavery.&quot; In an interview<br />
           published in <em>The Detroit Free Press</em> in 1997 he stated, &quot;I grew up listening to the music that expressed our hopes and soothed our sorrows. It became a part of me. So in a sense [it] is the link to our past.&quot;<br />
           <br />
           Dennard's activities also perpetuated the Harlem Renaissance ideal by promoting the music of African-American composers and fostering the heritage of the Negro spiritual. In addition to serving as a series editor for Alliance Music Publishers, Inc., Dennard's own compositions and arrangements of spirituals<br />
           further preserved this rich legacy. Through his work as a music educator, composer and arranger, choral conductor and founder of the Brazeal Dennard Chorale, he fostered the genre of the spiritual, along with works by contemporary black composers and masterpieces by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and others. Dennard built The Brazeal Dennard Chorale into a nationally recognized choir admired for its professionalism and wide repertoire.<br />
           <br />
           One of his greatest achievements was the preservation of spirituals, the religious folk songs of African-American slaves, which he championed through performances, recordings, workshops, guest conducting, published arrangements, articles, historical research and the dialogue he maintained for decades with choral directors and singers throughout the country. This project explores the musical significance, contribution to diversity in Christian traditions, and cultural impact of the spiritual through critical and rhetorical analysis of selected musical works by Brazeal Dennard, including: <em>Hush, Somebody's Calling My Name, Lord, I Want To Be A Christian</em>, and <em>Fare Ye Well</em>.</p>

           <b> English, Associate Professor. <em>Gender Labor: Co-Constructing Genders in Early Modern Literature</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> Drawn from my book project on male-to-female cross dressing in early modern literary texts, this talk explores a new idea in gender and sexuality theory?the notion of &ldquo;gender labor,&rdquo; in which a cisgender (not cross dressed or trans) partner participates in co-creating his or her partner&rsquo;s queer gender. While work on gender labor thus far has focused on contemporary subjects (see Ward, 2010), this chapter demonstrates the ways in which the concept can be generatively applied to an early modern context. For example, in Margaret Cavendish&rsquo;s?<em>Convent of Pleasure</em>?(1668), Lady Happy asks a? cross dressed &ldquo;Princess&rdquo; to participate in the convent&rsquo;s theatrical productions, and to play the role of a male suitor. In doing so, she takes the lead in creating a moment of male-to-female-to-male-cross-dressing, and also in initiating gender play and performance with her cross dressed love interest. This concept is pushed to its extremes in John Lyly&rsquo;s?<em>Gallathea</em>?(1592), in which two gender queer cross dressers each thinking that the other is male, create and enact romantic love scenes that involve gender play and a co-created divestment from biological sex. These instances of gender labor on the early modern stage, as well as in pamphlets and ballads, show an unexpected and exciting aspect of partnered investment in queer gender.</p>

             <b>Abstract:</b> <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the &ldquo;peaceful revolution&rdquo; that ushered in the demise of state socialism in East Germany. While some scholars have dismissed the term?</span><em>revolutionary</em>?to describe the upheaval of 1989 because of the absence of widespread violence, the relative bloodlessness of the events that brought down the unpopular regime have largely been a source of great admiration and even incredulity ? given the highly repressive nature of the communist regime, embodied first and foremost in the infamous?<em>Stasi</em>?(state security service). In an attempt to explain the pacific d?nouement of the mass protest movement, this talk will reexamine the world historic events of the?<em>Annus mirabilis</em>?by focusing in particular on largely forgotten violent encounters between the regime and the masses during the initial stages of the upheaval. That peaceful outcome was anything other than self-evident ? especially in light of the bloody events that had taken place at Tiananmen Square in China just several months earlier.</p>

           <b>CMLLC, Associate Professor. <em>Speaking the Unspeakable in Chinese?</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> English resorts to past tense to mark counterfactuals: e.g.?<em>I wish I?<strong>were</strong>??</em>and?<em>if I?<strong>had</strong>?gone</em>? Bloom (1981) suggests that speakers of the tenseless Chinese language (e.g.?<em>wo shi laoshi</em>: &lsquo;I am/was a teacher&rsquo;) cannot reason counterfactually. Au (1984) challenges Bloom&rsquo;s testing methods and his linguistic determinism, i.e. language conditions cognitive ability. Wu (1989) argues that Chinese employs?<strong>lexical items</strong>?(e.g.?<strong><em>yaobushi?</em></strong><em>ni cui</em>,?<em>wo buhui qu</em>: if not for your pushing me, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone) or?<strong>context</strong>?to disambiguate (counter) factuality. I propose that?<strong>syntax?</strong>in fact serves as a third factor that contributes to the encoding of counterfactuality in Chinese:?<strong>past reference in a hypothetical?<em>if</em>-clause can only have a past counterfactual interpretation.</strong>?A hypothetical?<em>if</em>-clause is a conditional that allows &lsquo;then&rsquo; in the matrix clause (Bhatt &amp; Pancheva 2006). This syntactic mechanism in Chinese, however, can only signal past counterfactuals, which makes it reasonable to hypothesize that, typologically, if a language can only mark one kind of temporal counterfactuals structurally, it must be the past-reference counterfactual, not the present or future one. I also argue that?<em>yaobushi?</em>does not guarantee a counterfactual interpretation; it depends on what focus adverb follows in the matrix clause.</p>

           <b>Sociology, Professor. <em>Contrasting Trends toward the 'Tough-Minded' and 'Tender-Minded' in Sociology and in the Humanities: An Empirical Study</em></b><br />
           <b>Abstract:</b> This paper focuses on contrasting trends, &quot;toughminded&quot; as against &quot;tender-minded,&quot; in sociology and in the humanities. This, a William James (1907) distinction of temperamental types, appears relevant for the examination of the above trends and is being used as an analytic tool in this study. The sociology and humanities samples were obtained from faculty interviews at a university in the North Central region of the United States, the respondents asked to present issues central to their disciplines. Judging from these interviews, the humanities appear to have seen a weakening of their more &quot;tender-minded&quot; side, such as semantics and Romance language studies, these apparently losing ground to their more &quot;toughminded&quot; side, such as linguistics and German language studies. In sociology, in contrast, the trend has been toward a growing balance between the &quot;tough-minded&quot; and &quot;tender-minded,&quot; seen in the recent emergence of Qualitative Sociology (Subjective and Objective idealist i.e., &quot;tenderminded&quot;) to a near equal status with the heretofore dominant &quot;Quantitative Sociology&quot; (empiricist and neo-positivist, i.e., tough-minded).</p>

             <b>Abstract:</b> Immigration is one of my areas of research interests and I enjoy comparing and contrasting the paces and patterns of mainstreaming of different immigrant populations in American mainstream.</p>
           <p>This presentation mainly aims at providing an understanding of immigration in general in the post digital American society and focuses on the diverse Indian community in United States and its contribution.</p>
<p>India?acts a huge powerhouse after china since it produces one of the largest technologically trained manpower in the world. There is a unique match between the push and pull factors of the technologically trained Indian labor force and the demanding white-collar job market created to jumpstart the declining manufacturing economy. Thus resulting in the best symbiotic relationship a host society and an immigrant community could have.</p>
<p>Immigration in this country has come in many distinct waves, each bringing with it a new and different challenge and opportunity. While history teaches us a lot about the immigration of old, not enough is known or said about the new wave of educated immigrants, such as Indians, coming to this country in recent decades.?I have often used different documentaries to discus different waves of immigration at different points of time. But have always felt the need for one of this kind that would discus the 21st?century global and local labor market and the Indian immigration to United States. This led to my documentary on Indian Immigrants to Michigan, that I have been working on for last six months.?. It focuses on the important contributions that the Indian immigrant community has made to American society and on the truly American value of pluralism, which allows immigrant minorities to survive, thrive and give back to the richness of American society as a whole. I hope this film will?provide a unique ethnic enrichment opportunity to American audiences, depicting Indians as people and as a culture.</p>

             <b>Abstract:</b> Patient-physician clinical communication concerning treatments options can be difficult for both patients and physicians, particularly when the patient is from a marginalized community. Using a resistance theoretical framework, combined with a culture-centered approach, this line of research examines passive and/or active resistance of treatment recommendations.? The case we present examines the process by which a patient employed resistance strategies in order to influence the outcome of a clinical interaction.?This case was selected from a larger archive of videos depicting clinical interactions with low-income African American patients.? Using qualitative discourse analysis as a method, we determined that the patient employed the following passive and active resistance strategies during the negotiation of treatment: 1) silence, 2) requesting explanations for the physician's recommended treatment, 3) explicit rejection, and 4) providing additional descriptions of his economic disadvantage as well as his previous failed attempts to find a successful treatment plan for his pain.? This patient's use of resistance strategies ultimately led to a collaboratively co-constructed and mutually acceptable treatment plan.</p>

            </strong><b>Abstract:</b> For the past thirty-five years, the Program for Research on Black Americans (PRBA), of which we are affiliated, has been conducting mental health and political studies of racial minority groups within the United States. The initial study, the National Survey of Black Americans, 1979-80 was an exclusive sample of the Black American population. Subsequent public opinion investigations, the 1984-88 National Black Election Studies and the 1993 National Black Politics Study, drew primary African American samples. A shift occurred with the 2004-08 National Politics Studies which sampled Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites that resided in census tracts in close proximity to blacks.???<br />
  <br />
  The relationship between religious variables and support for social welfare public policies across racial groups is the central theme in our research.??? Nonetheless, we find ourselves having to address an important research design question, in the main, how reliable are the comparative racial findings, from the PRBA surveys????? More to the point, if the sampling of White Americans consist of those that reside close to Blacks, can we with confidence report that the results advance our scientific knowledge about the associations between race, religion and social welfare attitudes?????<br />
  <br />
  The purpose of our talk is to address this question by sharing preliminary findings from national public opinion surveys showing that?race matters.? Regardless of how it is measured, exposure to sermons about social inequality has a positive and statistically significant influence on white attitudes toward social welfare policies.? This is not always the case for Black Americans and Hispanic Americans.?? We conclude our talk by raising the possibility of establishing a working group which further examines the interlocking themes of race, religion and social welfare attitudes.</p>

               <b>Africana Studies, Professor. <em>Adult Literacy Reforms through a Womanist Lens:? Unpacking the Radical Pedagogy of Civil Rights Era Educator, Bernice V. Robinson</em></b><br />
            <b>Abstract:</b> During the civil rights era in the Jim Crow South, literacy was the key to voting power and civic participation. Almost 200 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, African Americans faced severe <br />
            opposition to acquiring this fundamental skill. Barriers included segregation, second-class citizenship, violence, intimidation, and poverty. Thanks to the revolutionary work of the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee, and the radical pedagogical intervention of one of its associate members, Bernice Robinson, adult literacy reform became a transformative force that helped thousands of disenfranchised African Americans secure the vote. <br />
            <br />
            My lecture will explore the nuances of power and powerlessness in adult literacy pedagogy in the civil rights movement. Bernice Robinson became a literacy reformer and womanist, though she did not use these words to describe herself. Indeed, her literacy work exemplified key principles of the womanist epistemology, emphasizing self-help, self-definition, and community mobilization within the African American community.
